abstract = {Background
Synthetic cannabinoids are a significant public health concern, especially among incarcerated populations due to increased reports of abuse. Recent news reports have highlighted the severe consequences of K2/Spice, a synthetic cannabinoid, among the prison population in the United States. Despite regulations against cell phone use, inmates use TikTok to post K2/Spice-related content.
Objective
This study aimed to examine TikTok posts for use and illicit distribution of psychoactive substances (eg, K2/Spice) among incarcerated populations.
Methods
The study collected TikTok videos associated with the #k2spice hashtag and used a data collection approach similar to snowball sampling. Inductive coding was used to conduct content analysis of video characteristics. Videos were manually annotated to generate binary classifications related to the use of K2/Spice as well as selling and buying activities associated with it. Statistical analysis was used to determine associations between a video’s user engagement and an intent to buy or sell K2/Spice.
Results
A total of 89 TikTok videos with the hashtag #k2spice were manually coded, with 40% (n=36) identified as displaying the use, solicitation, or adverse effects of K2/Spice among the prison population. Of them, 44.44% (n=16) were in a prison-based setting documenting adverse effects including possible overdose. Videos with higher user engagement were positively correlated with comments indicating an intent to buy or sell K2/Spice.
Conclusions
K2/Spice is a drug subject to abuse among prison inmates in the United States, including depictions of its harmful effects being recorded and shared on TikTok. Lack of policy enforcement on TikTok and the need for better access to treatment services within the prison system may be exacerbating substance use among this highly vulnerable population. Minimizing the potential individual harm of this content on the incarcerated population should be a priority for social media platforms and the criminal justice system alike.}

abstract = {Purpose
Taking the COVID-19 as the background, this study aims to investigate the direct influencing factors regarding knowledge sharing behavior (KSB) on new media platforms and discuss how the characteristics of the users could enhance the KSB through moderation effect, and provide empirical evidences.
Design/methodology/approach
Based on the social exchange theory and after the text analysis of the data collected from the Tiktok platform in 2020, this paper uses the quantitative method to evaluate the factors influence KSB on short video social platform during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Findings
KSB on new media platform could be enhanced by richer knowledge content of the video posted and the attribute of the platform users directly. Platform users could affect the trustworthiness of the knowledge shared, thus influence the knowledge sharing. On the early stage of the COVID-19, the richer content of the knowledge released by users could effectively enhance the KSB. On the early stage of the emergency events, the official users could play a significant role on KS. During the mitigation stage of COVID-19, the KSB of the knowledge shared by unofficial users with richer content could be enhanced and the moderation effect is relatively stronger.
Originality/value
The research extends the social exchange theory to a disaster management context. The authors provide an effective reference for future governments to effectively cope with the epidemic and spread public knowledge in an emergency response context. By analyzing the influence of knowledge content and influencer characteristics, it could help the social media platform to improve content management and optimize resource allocation.}

abstract = {Purpose
In the U.S., TikTok surged in popularity as the COVID-19 virus spread nationally. TikTok posts may both reflect and shape young people's perceptions of the pandemic. This mixed methods study applied a uses and gratifications framework to a systematic analysis of trending TikToks related to COVID-19, with attention to changes over a 2-month period.
Methods
Analyses are based on an original data set of 2,675 TikToks (529 unique videos across 68 COVID-relevant hashtags) viewed over 2,840,347,014 times. TikToks were tracked daily for 65 days after the beginning of U.S. stay-at-home orders (March 17 to May 20, 2020). A thematic analysis used 28 content codes and nine codes related to subject(s) to examine content patterns. Chi-square tests facilitated analyses of changes over time.
Results
Trending TikToks related to COVID-19 most often featured details of everyday circumstances and/or relatable commentary on Pandemic Life. These posts were similarly prevalent in Months 1 and 2. Health-Promoting TikToks outnumbered those exhibiting Risky or Concerning Health Practices (58:13) and were more common in Month 1. Advertisements and sponsored campaigns also shaped trending COVID-relevant content during the study period.
Conclusions
On TikTok, public health information appears to coexist with an abundance of commentary about everyday life during the pandemic. Posts arguably reflect documented social media use goals such as information seeking/sharing, archiving, and self-expression. Yet, TikToks during the pandemic period perhaps most often connect to another previously undocumented use goal: a digital search for common humanity in seeing difficult experiences as part of a larger human experience.}

In recent years, integrating text and image data for sentiment analysis in social networks has become a key approach. However, techniques for capturing complex cross-modal information and effectively fusing multimodal features still have shortcomings. We design a multimodal sentiment analysis model called the Dynamic Graph-Text Fusion Network (DGFN) to address these challenges. Text features are captured by leveraging the neighborhood information aggregation properties of Graph Convolutional Networks, treating words as nodes and integrating their features through their adjacency relationships. Additionally, the multi-head attention mechanism is utilized to extract rich semantic information from different subspaces simultaneously. For image feature extraction, a convolutional attention module is employed. Subsequently, an attention-based fusion module integrates the text and image features. Experimental results on the two datasets show significant improvements in sentiment classification accuracy and F1 scores, validating the effectiveness of the proposed DGFN model.}

Using Named Entity Recognition, emotion analysis, topic clustering, and opinion mining, the study reveals key themes, entities, and emotional responses among Chinese netizens. The analysis shows that Chinese netizens express views on humanitarian concerns, calls for peace, support for Palestinian national liberation, and demands for accurate information. Emotion-opinion cross-analysis reveals that their responses are shaped by a mix of emotions, including anger towards external geopolitical forces, fear and sadness regarding humanitarian impacts, and hope for peace and resolution. These emotions illustrate the complex interplay between humanitarian concerns, political stances, and support for diplomacy, demonstrating Weibo’s role as a platform for amplifying public sentiment. The study also examines how Chinese public opinion aligns with the Chinese government’s stance on international affairs. Findings indicate broad support for the government’s diplomatic efforts, such as calls for ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and mediation. This alignment reflects an expectation for China to actively contribute to global peace and stability. Additionally, the study uncovers critical perspectives on external influences, with many netizens criticizing perceived biases in international responses and advocating for a balanced, multilateral diplomatic approach. Overall, this research highlights how a distant geopolitical crisis is understood in China’s socio-political context, revealing an emerging global consciousness among Chinese netizens. This shift, facilitated by Weibo, reflects a movement from a state-centric narrative to an active public engagement with global issues.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) represents a crucial field of natural language processing (NLP). It focuses on deriving detailed sentiment insights from textual content. Dialogue-level aspect-based sentiment quadruple extraction (DiaASQ) is specifically concerned with pinpointing target-aspect-opinion-emotion quadruples within conversations. DiaASQ is important in industries like e-commerce, social media analytics, and customer feedback. However, Current ABSA approaches predominantly focus on single-text scenarios, often overlooking the complexities involved in sentiment analysis within conversational contexts. To fill this gap, this paper presents the IFusionQuad model, which is specifically designed for the DiaASQ task. Our contributions include the innovative integration of CloBlock in ABSA, enhancing feature representation with context-aware weights. The InteractiveNet Fusion Module further advances dialogue understanding by aggregating dialogue-specific features such as threads, speakers, and replies. Components such as CloBlock, gating mechanism, and Biaffine attention effectively mitigate data noise issues, improving the relevance of feature extraction. Empirical evaluation on standard datasets demonstrates that the IFusionQuad model outperforms baseline methods, achieving substantial improvements in quadruple extraction. Specifically, our model shows a 6.59% increase in micro F1 and a 7.05% increase in identification F1 for Chinese datasets, and a 2.65% and 4.69% increase in micro F1 and identification F1, respectively, for English datasets. The results clearly demonstrate our IFusionQuad model’s efficacy, which consistently outperforms baseline models across all evaluation datasets on the DiaASQ task.}

The first focused on the video characteristics, including engagement metrics such as likes, comments, shares, and saves, while the second analyzed comment threads for themes within the SDH framework. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Mann-Whitney U test to evaluate differences in engagement metrics based on the presence or absence of the themes. Videos addressing Employment Opportunities (76 %), Economic Mobility (68 %), and Education Quality (65 %) received the highest engagement. The comment analysis showed significant associations between themes such as Income Potential, Employment Opportunities, Economic Mobility, Social Capital, Debt and Financial Stress with higher video likes. However, health related themes, despite being integral to the SDH framework, were either absent or insignificant in comment discussions. These findings underscore the public's emphasis on financial and career-related concerns over broader health implications. Future research should explore the extent to which SDH-related benefits—such as health resources, access, and literacy—influence decisions about pursuing higher education.}

Investigators watched and coded videos using a codebook that captured details about featured individuals, product claims and details, and other video elements (e.g., language, use of popular music). Descriptive statistics were obtained to analyze trends within and across product hashtags. A total of 78 #dietpills, 86 #preworkout, and 69 #detox videos met study criteria. Videos promoting weight-loss and cleanse/detox products overwhelmingly featured feminine-presenting (70.5 % and 71 %, respectively) and thin (35.9 % and 44.9 %) individuals, while #preworkout video subjects were mostly masculine-presenting (73.3 %) and muscular (61.6 %). Most did not disclose their credentials (93.6 %) nor identify whether the promotion of the product was sponsored by the retailer (95.7 %). The vast majority of videos (97 %) did not provide any scientific evidence to support health- and appearance-related claims.

Social media platforms, such as TikTok, may be powerful vectors for transmission of both harmful and helpful self-harm and suicide-related content; however, this has not been rigorously studied.
Objective
This study aims to identify and understand the themes and overall characteristics of videos related to self-harm and suicide on TikTok.
Methods
Snowball sampling was used to identify the 10 most-viewed TikTok hashtags related to self-harm and suicide, which were then used to select the most-viewed English-language posts up to June 2023. An inductive coding reliability approach to thematic analysis was iteratively applied by 2 independent coders to identify and analyze common themes within the videos.
Results
In total, 188 videos were included in the thematic analysis. Five main themes and 2 subthemes were identified: emotional distress, hope and recovery-based messaging, grief and memorialization of those who died by suicide, social functions associated with self-harm and suicide-related content (subthemes: gallows humor and sarcasm; glamorization of self-harm and suicide-related behavior), and shame and guilt associated with self-harm and suicide-related behavior.
Conclusions
Self-harm and suicide-related content on TikTok was diverse, encompassing both potentially harmful (eg, normalization of self-harm behavior) and helpful (eg, recovery-focused messaging) characteristics. Therefore, a multifaceted and collaborative approach is needed to address the risks of potentially harmful content while leveraging the positive characteristics to promote the safety and well-being of TikTok users.}

Videos with higher view counts were liked and shared at higher rates and sustained viewer attention for longer. Properties like hashtags, sounds, and effects did not significantly influence video views.

abstract = {Background
TikTok’s MedTok is an interconnected network of patients, providers, and producers sharing knowledge and experiences of health-related topics. Awareness of popular content on weight loss medications can benefit health care professionals, especially regarding adverse effects and management.
Objectives
Describe content in popular TikTok videos using adverse effect hashtags for gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. Compare content between health care and non-health care creators and reported adverse effects versus medication package inserts.
Methods
This observational study evaluated videos for popular GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist side-effect hashtags on TikTok, in June 2023. Video metadata collected included content creator demographics and content of video, including adverse effects discussed and recommendations to address these. Adverse effects were compared to package insert data. Qualitative data was evaluated through descriptive coding, quantitative data through descriptive statistics, and Pearson chi-square for comparisons.
Results
A total of 165 videos were analyzed. Content creators were mostly medication users (89%) and non-health care professionals (90%). Medication indications included weight loss (82%), polycystic ovarian syndrome (20%), and diabetes (6%). Diet, exercise, or weight loss were discussed in 34%, 16%, and 38% of videos, respectively. Non-health care professionals mentioned specific products to address adverse effects more frequently than health care professionals, 24% versus 13% (P = 0.292). All adverse effects mentioned in at least 5 videos aligned with medication package inserts, most commonly gastrointestinal disturbances, except for insomnia.
Conclusion
Most content creators were non-health care professionals and medication users. Despite Ozempic and Mounjaro lacking Food and Drug Administration approval for weight loss at the time, it was the most identified indication. The alignment of most reported adverse effects with medication package inserts underscores the reliability of user-shared experiences, though discrepancies like insomnia were noted. Given TikTok's remarkable reach and influence, awareness of patient-reported experiences and recommendations is essential for health care providers to enhance care and dispel misconceptions.}

Drawing on the pleasure-arousal-dominance model and flow theory, this study empirically investigates the relationships among perceived value, flow experience, emotional pleasure, and purchase intention by using a questionnaire survey of 257 consumers of Tiktok subordinating to online social media marketing in China. The results indicate that hedonic value and utilitarian value are positively associated with consumer purchase intention, respectively. Emotional pleasure mediates the relationship between perceived value and purchase intention, while flow experience positively moderates the relationships between hedonic value and emotional pleasure and between emotional pleasure and purchase intention. This study extends the online social media marketing literature related to consumer purchase intention. The results provide implications for future research and for operators and marketers.}

This study leveraged the emotional contagion theory to construct an econometric model and investigate the factors influencing viewers' instant order cancellation behaviors. An extensive dataset was assembled, comprising 4984 product introduction video segments from 768 TikTok livestreaming rooms in China, along with 1.29 million bullet screen comments and 513,551 viewers' information. Employing advanced multimodal data processing technologies, the study extracted anchors' (livestreaming hosts) multimodal emotion features. The empirical findings demonstrate the significant impact of anchors' emotions, encompassing body movements, facial expressions, voices, and conversation contents, on the arousal and valence of group emotions, where the latter exhibit opposing effects on instant order cancellation behavior. This research establishes the paramount roles of anchor and group emotions in viewers' instant order cancellation behaviors, lending credence to the epistemological applicability of emotional contagion theory in the context of LSE. The study's findings offer LSE practitioners practical implications to enhance business decision-making, fostering more engaging and emotionally resonant livestreaming experiences to reduce cancellations and improve customer retention.}

With 4.2 million nurses in the United States, it is estimated less than 10% are members of professional organizations. These professional organizations are the primary groups advocating on behalf of the profession. How are we developing legislative agenda’s that meet the need of the profession if less than 10% of nurses are engaging and speaking up? There are multiple ways nurse leaders can engage frontline staff in the advocacy process. Levels of engagement can range from within the organization to local, state, national, and global efforts. The opportunities to engage are endless. We are 4 million strong, yet we struggle to have an aligned collective voice. Our divide begins with unions versus non-unions, mandated staffing ratios versus other staffing models, associate degree versus bachelor’s degree, and so on. How do we ever expect to be heard if we are not aligning our voices and coming to consensus on what is best for the profession as a whole? Social media is not getting us in front of the right people. As leaders, we must role model what advocacy looks like and provide avenues for our nurses to engage in this process.}

abstract = {Background
Mpox has reemerged as a global public health concern. With the growing reliance on social media for health information dissemination, understanding public perception through these platforms is essential for designing effective health promotion strategies.
Objective
This study analyzes TikTok data related to mpox using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. This paper aims to extract key topics and inform targeted health promotion strategies for mpox prevention and control.
Methods
Using the “Aisou Jisou” system, we collected TikTok data containing the keyword “Mpox” from April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2025. The dataset comprised 25,672 text data and associated search terms. We analyzed trends in the Search Index and Target Group Index (TGI) across time, gender, age groups, and provinces. LDA topic modeling was applied to identify latent topics within the text data, and topic evolution was examined during 4 peak months of the Search Index.
Results
A total of 4 major Search Index peaks were identified on TikTok in China, which are May 2022, July 2023, August 2024, and February 2025. These peaks aligned with key global and national mpox events, including WHO’s declaration of a global mpox outbreak in May 2022 and the detection of the clade Ib Mpox in China in January 2025. TGI analysis revealed that users aged 18‐23 years exhibited the highest engagement. Spatially, Beijing, Tianjin, and Jilin recorded the highest cumulative TGI values (5922.38, 5692.41, and 3579.90, respectively). LDA topic modeling identified 8 primary topics, including transmission and prevention, vaccine concerns, and misinformation, etc. Public attention evolved from general disease knowledge toward issues of stigmatization and vaccine distrust over time. Sankey diagrams illustrated shifts in public attention across topics at different Search Index peaks, with “Mpox Transmission and Prevention” receiving the most attention in May 2022 and “Mpox Vaccination and Infection Prevention” in February 2025.
Conclusions
TikTok provides real-time insights into public attention during mpox outbreaks, but can also propagate misinformation and stigmatizing narratives. Public health authorities should leverage these platforms for timely communication, actively address misinformation, and mitigate social bias. Tailored strategies are needed to enhance health literacy, minimize stigma, and strengthen outbreak preparedness and response. This study highlights the dual role of social media as both an information source and a potential vector for misinformation, emphasizing the necessity for active monitoring and regulation by health authorities to ensure the accuracy and reliability of disseminated health information.}

Based on grounded theory, Study 1 identifies five content characteristics of short-form video ads: trustworthiness, expertise, attractiveness, authenticity, and brand heritage. Study 2 examines the impact of these characteristics on consumer purchase behavior by analyzing 2,578 valid videos released on TikTok by 128 users from January to December 2022. The results suggest that trustworthiness, expertise, and attractiveness are positively related to consumer purchase, whereas authenticity and brand heritage influence consumer purchase behaviors in a U-shaped manner. This study has theoretical and managerial implications for stakeholders.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the quality of varicocele information on TikTok, a popular video platform that adolescent patients are now turning to as a source of medical information before visiting a doctor.
Methods
Using the key word “varicocele,” we retrieved the top 225 videos listed on TikTok in May 2022. We extracted general video and engagement data. Video information was coded and analyzed for the completeness of different types of content (definition, symptoms, evaluation, management, and outcomes). The quality of consumer health information was rated using the DISCERN instrument.
Results
Thirty-six videos met inclusion criteria; 17 were created by general users, 16 by healthcare professionals or systems (2 by urologists), and 3 by scientific communities. Healthcare professionals had more views than non-healthcare (P = .05). The quality of health information using the DISCERN instrument was “poor” from health care professional videos and “very poor” from non-health care professionals. However, the quality of information provided by healthcare professionals was statistically better than that of non-healthcare (P< .05). Video content mainly focused on symptoms: 50% of videos from healthcare providers had some or extensive content and 41% of non-healthcare had some content. 23% of videos had misinformation.
Conclusion
The overall quality of information for varicoceles on TikTok is not acceptable and does not meet patient needs. It is imperative that urologists create robust, accurate content, and partner with these platforms to connect users with higher quality information. TikTok users should also be mindful that information may not be medically accurate.}

Influencers organize sentences of different sentiment valence in a specific sequence when offering products’ basic information, sharing usage experiences, and providing product evaluations in the product recommendation posts, resulting in dynamic changes in sentence sentiment valence, that is, sentiment volatility. Drawing on narrative transportation theory, an investigation—combining an analysis of 12,849 influencer product recommendation posts on the Xiaohongshu platform (Study 1) and a further controlled experiment (Study 2) — reveals that sentiment volatility negatively affects customer engagement and this effect is driven by narrative transportation.

Wild meat trade poses significant threats to biodiversity and human health. Despite these threats, trade and consumption are increasing, driven largely by growing demand in urban centers. Easy access to the internet and social media platforms further facilitates wildlife trade and consumption by connecting traders and consumers. This study examines 80 TikTok videos from public (open) accounts of two wild meat traders in Lomé, Togo, showcasing wild meat sales between November 2022 and April 2024. The videos featured various smoked wild animals, representing approximately 3,526 individuals across 27 inferred species, predominantly birds (40.9%) and mammals (39.6%), but also included reptiles (19.5%). Prices for whole smoked animals varied significantly (from a minimum of 3.4 USD to a maximum of 340 USD), depending on the species and the size of the individual animal. Among the 27 recorded species were the Endangered white-bellied pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis), classified as a CITES Appendix I species with a declining population trend; the Vulnerable Buffon’s kob (Kobus kob ssp. kob); the Near Threatened Defassa waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus ssp. defassa); and three CITES II-listed species. The 80 videos had each been viewed between 660 and 216,000 times, and all 80 videos had been viewed 1,795,079 times in total. This high level of visibility may fuel demand and unintentionally promote further trade by exposing a broad audience to such content. The findings highlight how social media can have significant negative conservation implications for the long-term survival and sustainable management of these species. Although enforcement mechanisms have been implemented to curb illegal wildlife trade on social media, these platforms still serve as vast, often unregulated marketplaces where traders and customers can easily connect, offering a level of convenience that traditional markets lack. We recommend that social media platforms strengthen their enforcement measures while conservationists leverage these platforms to raise awareness, promote wildlife protection laws, and mobilize public support for conservation efforts. The demand for wild meat in Lomé is driven by the growing population, cultural and economic benefits, as well as a lack of awareness. The study highlights the urgent need for targeted education, stronger enforcement of wildlife protection laws, and better communication about the legal status and conservation importance of the species.}

We aimed to compare the metrics, creator type, tone, and content of TikTok videos tagged with #HormonalBirthControl to those tagged with #FertilityAwarenessMethod.
Methods
We collected two convenience samples of 100 videos tagged with either #HormonalBirthControl or #FertilityAwarenessMethod on TikTok using the data-scraping program Apify (Prague, Czech Republic). We extracted number of views, likes, comments, and shares, and analyzed for tone, themes, and creator demographics. Two independent reviewers coded the videos and a third arbitrated differences.
Results
A total of 90 videos tagged with #HormonalBirthControl and 86 with #FertilityAwarenessMethod met our inclusion criteria of being publicly available, in English, and relevant to the topic. Of the #HormonalBirthControl videos, 63.3% had a negative tone compared to 24.4% of the #FertilityAwarenessMethod videos. Patients created 73.3% of the #HormonalBirthControl videos. Non-medical professionals who describe themselves as “fertility awareness educators” and “hormone health coaches” created 83.5% of #FertilityAwarenessMethod videos. #FertilityAwarenessMethod videos were shared an average of 2,280.6 times compared to 230.6 times for #HormonalBirthControl videos. Of #HormonalBirthControl videos, 67.8% mentioned birth control side effects/symptoms and 22.2% mentioned distrust of Western medicine and/or physicians. Of the #FertilityAwarenessMethod videos, 39.5% referenced a lack of reproductive education.
Conclusions
Most of the TikTok content about hormonal birth control and fertility awareness methods were not created by medical professionals. There appears to be significant interest in fertility awareness methods based on the high number of video shares. The conversations surrounding hormonal birth control are dominated by concerns about hormonal side effects. There is room for medical professionals to create educational content on these topics.}

By analyzing short video advertisements from TikTok, we find four key audiovisual features—namely, colloquial expression, cadence, colorfulness, and visual prominence—that are significantly correlated with consumer engagement behaviors. For the first time, we integrate these audiovisual features with the multimodal theory and the elaboration likelihood model, enriching the research literature on consumer perception. Furthermore, we discover the moderating effect of product types and release time.

Background
To analyze the content, reliability, and quality of relevant TikTok videos regarding orthodontic retention.
Methods
Six relevant terms were searched on the TikTok social media Web site. Uploaded videos satisfying inclusion/exclusion criteria were assessed for the presence of nine predetermined content domains and categorized as “high-content” (≥5) or “low-content” (<5). Reliability was determined using the DISCERN instrument and quality by the Global Quality Score (GQS). Layperson videos were evaluated for themes using discourse analysis. Intraclass coefficients for content, DISCERN scores, and GQS were calculated for intrarater reliability. Statistical analysis was via IBM SPSS Statistics (version 27.0.0.0; SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL).
Results
Orthodontists uploaded 37.8% and laypersons 34% of the 209 assessed videos. Just 22.1% of videos were considered to be ‘high-content.’ Quality of life issues related to retainer wear was the domain that was present least often in the videos provided by orthodontists (13.9%) and most often in those uploaded by laypersons (53.5%). High-content videos recorded greater mean GQS and DISCERN scores compared with low-content videos (P < 0.001). Strong positive associations existed between the number of domains present and DISCERN scores (rho = 0.808; P < 0.01) and between GQS and DISCERN scores (rho = 0.67; P < 0.01). Intraclass coefficient scores ranged between 0.92 and 0.98. Dissatisfaction with the need for long-term retainer wear was a prevalent negative theme in layperson videos.
Conclusions
The content, reliability, and quality of TikTok videos regarding orthodontic retention were poor. The orthodontic profession must use TikTok effectively to ensure it delivers high-quality information relevant to laypersons’ concerns.}

abstract = {Background
TikTok is a microvideo social media platform currently experiencing rapid growth and with 60% of its monthly users between the ages of 16 and 24 years. Increased exposure to e-cigarette content on social media may influence patterns of use, including the risk of overconsumption and possible nicotine poisoning, when users engage in trending challenges online. However, there is limited research assessing the characteristics of nicotine poisoning–related content posted on social media.
Objective
We aimed to assess the characteristics of content on TikTok that is associated with a popular nicotine poisoning–related hashtag.
Methods
We collected TikTok posts associated with the hashtag #nicsick, using a Python programming package (Selenium) and used an inductive coding approach to analyze video content and characteristics of interest. Videos were manually annotated to generate a codebook of the nicotine sickness–related themes. Statistical analysis was used to compare user engagement characteristics and video length in content with and without active nicotine sickness TikTok topics.
Results
A total of 132 TikTok videos associated with the hashtag #nicsick were manually coded, with 52.3% (69/132) identified as discussing firsthand and secondhand reports of suspected nicotine poisoning symptoms and experiences. More than one-third of nicotine poisoning–related content (26/69, 37.68%) portrayed active vaping by users, which included content with vaping behavior such as vaping tricks and overconsumption, and 43% (30/69) of recorded users self-reported experiencing nicotine sickness, poisoning, or adverse events such as vomiting following nicotine consumption. The average follower count of users posting content related to nicotine sickness was significantly higher than that for users posting content unrelated to nicotine sickness (W=2350.5, P=.03).
Conclusions
TikTok users openly discuss experiences, both firsthand and secondhand, with nicotine adverse events via the #nicsick hashtag including reports of overconsumption resulting in sickness. These study results suggest that there is a need to assess the utility of digital surveillance on emerging social media platforms for vaping adverse events, particularly on sites popular among youth and young adults. As vaping product use-patterns continue to evolve, digital adverse event detection likely represents an important tool to supplement traditional methods of public health surveillance (such as poison control center prevalence numbers).}

keywords = {misinformation, social media, TikTok, alternative health, cancer, computer vision},
abstract = {Background
Health misinformation is abundant online and becoming an increasingly pressing concern for both oncology practitioners and patients with cancer. On social media platforms, including the popular audiovisual app TikTok, the flourishing alternative health industry is further contributing to the spread of misleading and often harmful information, endangering patients’ health and outcomes and sowing distrust of the medical community. The prevalence of false and potentially dangerous treatments on a platform that is used as a quasi–search engine by young people poses a serious risk to the health of patients with cancer.
Objective
This study seeks to examine how cancer discourse on TikTok differs between alternative health and conventional medicine videos. It aims to look beyond mere facts and falsehoods that TikTok users may utter to understand the visual language and format used in the support of both misleading and truthful narratives, as well as other messages.
Methods
Using computer vision analysis and subsequent qualitative close reading of 831 TikTok videos, this study examined how alternative health and conventional medicine videos on cancer differ with regard to the visual language used. Videos were examined for the length of time and prominence in which faces are displayed, as well as for the background setting, location, and dominant color scheme.
Results
The results show that the alt-health and conventional health samples made different use of the audiovisual affordances of TikTok. First, videos from the alternative health sample were more likely to contain a single face that was prominently featured (making up at least 7.5% of the image) for a substantial period of time (35% of the shots), with these testimonial-style videos making up 28.5% (93/326) of the sample compared to 18.6% (94/505) of the conventional medicine sample. Alternative health videos predominantly featured cool tones (P<.001) and were significantly more likely to be filmed outdoors (P<.001), whereas conventional medicine videos were more likely to be shot indoors and feature warm tones such as red, orange, or yellow.
Conclusions
The findings of this study contribute to an increased understanding of misinformation as not merely a matter of individual falsehoods but also a phenomenon whose effects might be transported through emotive as well as rational means. They also point to influencer practices and style being an important contributing factor in the declining health of the information environment around cancer and its treatment. The results suggest that public health efforts must extend beyond correcting false statements by injecting factual information into the online cancer discourse and look toward incorporating both visual and rational strategies.}

Trade in exotic pets is a particularly understudied issue in Canada. While Canadians generally have pro-environmental attitudes, it is unclear whether this extends to the trade in exotic animals. With most Canadians on social media, we aimed to use Natural Language Processing of social data to examine public sentiment towards exotic pet trade in Canada. We analysed 9,274 posts on Twitter (now 'X') about exotic pets between 2012 and 2022, and 150,236 comments from 2568 TikTok videos showing exotic pets from 50 unique Canadian accounts. We found that social media users demonstrate markedly positive attitudes towards the live trade in reptiles and amphibians, mammals, birds, and arachnids and insects, even on TikTok videos showing poor animal care and questionable legality. We propose a conceptual framework for how exotic pet influencers directly and indirectly contribute to increased demand for exotic pets through opinion leadership, sharing information on where to buy exotic pets, and normalising exotic pet ownership. We suggest that it is important to raise public awareness among social media users about the challenges associated with wildlife trade, including animal welfare considerations, and the links between exotic pet trade and conservation.}

abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for reliable information, especially around vaccines. Vaccine hesitancy is a growing concern and a great threat to broader public health. The prevalence of social media within our daily lives emphasizes the importance of accurately analyzing how health information is being disseminated to the public. TikTok is of particular interest, as it is an emerging social media platform that young adults may be increasingly using to access health information.
Objective
The objective of this study was to examine and describe the content within the top 100 TikToks trending with the hashtag #covidvaccine.
Methods
The top 250 most viewed TikToks with the hashtag #covidvaccine were batch downloaded on July 1, 2021, with their respective metadata. Each TikTok was subsequently viewed and encoded by 2 independent reviewers. Coding continued until 100 TikToks could be included based on language and content. Descriptive features were recorded including health care professional (HCP) status of creator, verification of HCP status, genre, and misinformation addressed. Primary inclusion criteria were any TikToks in English with discussion of a COVID-19 vaccine.
Results
Of 102 videos included, the median number of plays was 1,700,000, with median shares of 9224 and 62,200 followers. Upon analysis, 14.7% (15/102) of TikToks included HCPs, of which 80% (12/102) could be verified via social media or regulatory body search; 100% (15/15) of HCP-created TikToks supported vaccine use, and overall, 81.3% (83/102) of all TikToks (created by either a layperson or an HCP) supported vaccine use.
Conclusions
As the pandemic continues, vaccine hesitancy poses a threat to lifting restrictions, and discovering reasons for this hesitancy is important to public health measures. This study summarizes the discourse around vaccine use on TikTok. Importantly, it opens a frank discussion about the necessity to incorporate new social media platforms into medical education, so we might ensure our trainees are ready to engage with patients on novel platforms.}

We also found that trolling comments target their own party and politicians more often than they target their political opponents, and that more trolling comments that target such posts are humoristic, while more trolling comments that target their opponents are malevolent. Even though the extent of trolling comments on Republicans’ posts is higher than on Democrats’ posts, Democrats are the target of trolling more often, both on their own posts and on Republicans’ posts. Furthermore, Republicans’ posts target Democrats more often than they promote their own agenda, but Democrats’ posts promote their own agenda more often than they target Republicans. We contribute evidence of political trolling on TikTok that reflects the US’ asymmetric politics and politainment, and that raises the need to conduct more nuanced research on the relationships between trolling perpetrators and their targets.}

The top 50 videos for search terms “ileostomy,” “colostomy,” “ostomy,” and “stoma” were queried on TikTok. Information was compiled regarding the videos’ creators, content type, overall sentiment, and viewer engagement.
Results
A total of 113 videos amongst 38 creators garnered 52,021,700 likes and 370,983 comments. Most videos focused on education (45.5%) and personal stories (22.7%). Creators were predominantly young females (82.0%), with minimal input from healthcare professionals (3% of videos). Sixty-nine (61%) of videos had responses with further questions.
Conclusions
Our study reveals a gap between interest and availability of professional educational material regarding intestinal ostomies. Addressing this deficiency may improve patient acceptance, bystander understanding, and its negative stigma.}

Physicians aim to provide optimal care, considering patient experiences and satisfaction. Traditional in-clinic surveys assessing surgical experiences face numerous limitations, including response bias, and inadequate inclusion of diverse demographics. Social media is an emerging platform for patients to share their healthcare experiences, providing an alternative method for gathering patient feedback. This study explores the prevalent themes of moyamoya disease experiences shared on social media.
Methods
Posts containing "#moyamoya" and "#moyamoyawarrior" from Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter were analyzed. Posts unrelated to direct patient experiences were excluded. Relevant posts were categorized by themes and analyzed based on the platform, gender, and identity of the poster (patient or someone else). Chi-squared tests were used to determined significance of theme prevalence.
Results
Of the 1,005 social media posts analyzed, 63.8 % were by patients, and 75.0 % were by females. Most patients (83.0 %) had undergone one surgery. Instagram posts most often focused on Recovery/Rehabilitation (69.7 %), Survival (66.7 %), and Spreading Positivity (45.8 %), while TikTok posts more frequently discussed Survival (97.2 %), Recovery/Rehabilitation (81.3 %), and Spreading Positivity (84.1 %) (p < 0.001). Females were less likely to post on these themes than males, who discussed religious topics more frequently (p = 0.029). Patients discussed appearance (p < 0.001), resiliency (p = 0.002), and quality of life (p = 0.014) more than their loved ones.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates social media's use among moyamoya patients, and can supplement traditional methods of obtaining patient feedback. Despite limitations, leveraging social media can enhance understanding patient needs, ultimately improving care quality for Moyamoya disease patients.}

abstract = {Parents of children with type 1 diabetes, a deadly illness made chronic through its management, have posted thousands of videos on the social media platform TikTok with hashtags such as #diabetictoddler, #type1mom, and #type1family. Filmed in different styles and set to different music, these videos all feature parents caring for their children by acting upon their bodies as they insert, inject, remove, and reconfigure the biotechnologies of diabetes management. Building from recent studies that show that parents share the embodiment of their children's type 1 diabetes as stress and anxiety related to managing a potentially fatal condition, this article explores how parents use TikTok to visibilize interembodiment. In TikTok videos, interembodiment hinges on shared disease management rather than shared disease symptom or etiology. Moving from the position that people do not simply possess bodies but continually enact them, we explore how parents and children jointly enact diabetes through an entanglement of bodies, voices, medical technologies, and social media personae that appear in #diabetictoddler and #type1mom TikToks. Given some of these videos have circulated to millions of people, we propose that TikTok and other social media platforms provide unique forums for type 1 parents to make their interembodiment visible, perhaps even as a salve for the distress they suffer as they manage their children's illnesses.}

abstract = {Background
Little cigars and cigarillos (LCCs) are popular tobacco products among youth (ie, adolescents and young adults). A variety of LCC-related promotional and user-generated content is present on social media. However, research on LCC-related posts on social media has been largely focused on platforms that are primarily text- or image-based, such as Twitter and Instagram.
Objective
This study analyzed LCC-related content on TikTok, an audio and video–based platform popular among youth.
Methods
Publicly available posts (N=811) that contained the LCC-related hashtags #swishersweets or #backwoods were collected on TikTok from January 2019 to May 2021. Metadata were also collected, including numbers of likes, comments, shares, and views per video. Using an inductive approach, a codebook consisting of 26 themes was developed to help summarize the underlying themes evident in the TikTok videos and corresponding captions. A pairwise co-occurrence analysis of themes was also conducted to evaluate connections among themes.
Results
Among the 811 posts, the LCC presence theme (ie, a visible LCC) occurred in the most prominent number of posts (n=661, 81.5%), followed by music (n=559, 68.9%), youth (n=332, 40.9%), humor (n=263, 32.4%), LCC use (n=242, 29.8%), flavors (n=232, 28.6%), branding (n=182, 22.4%), paraphernalia (n=137, 16.9%), blunt rolling (n=94, 11.6%), and price (n=84, 10.4%). Product reviews had the highest engagement, with a median 44 (mean 2857, range 36,499) likes and median 491 (mean 15,711, range 193,590) views; followed by product comparisons, with a median 44 (mean 1920, range 36,500) likes and median 671 (mean 11,277, range 193,798) views. Promotions had the lowest engagement, with a median 4 (mean 8, range 34) likes and median 78 (mean 213, range 1131) views. The most prevalent themes co-occurring with LCC presence were (1) music (434/811, 53.5%), (2) youth (264/811, 32.6%), (3) humor (219/811, 27%), (4) flavors (214/811, 26.4%), and (5) LCC use (207/811, 25.5%).
Conclusions
LCC-related marketing and user-generated content was present on TikTok, including videos showing youth discussing, displaying, or using LCCs. Such content may be in violation of TikTok’s community guidelines prohibiting the display, promotion, or posting of tobacco-related content on its platform, including the display of possession or consumption of tobacco by a minor. Further improvement in the enforcement of TikTok community guidelines and additional scrutiny from public health policy makers may be necessary for protecting youth from future exposure to tobacco-related posts. Observational and experimental studies are needed to understand the impact of exposure to LCC-related videos on attitudes and behaviors related to LCC use among youth. Finally, there may be a need for engaging antitobacco videos that appeal to youth on TikTok to counter the protobacco content on this platform.}

abstract = {In early 2023, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) industry experienced a significant advancement with the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT, a research product that demonstrated remarkable capabilities and garnered widespread attention. ChatGPT is an advanced chatbot powered by the Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) architecture, designed to generate human-like conversations encompassing a wide range of knowledge domains. Many AI researchers are currently engaging with the new technology to understand its functionality and limitations. Various expressions across a range of social media platforms, including Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and numerous others, are currently under investigation. This research seeks to analyze the opinions of ChatGPT users as it regards cybersecurity. This research is important due to its contribution towards gaining enhanced understanding and devising intricate improvements for the chatbot. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm is utilized to extract relevant topics from the texts. Additionally, to analyze user opinions and decipher the sentiments as either positive, negative, or neutral, we use the Natural language tool kit Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning (NLTK's VADER) and Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (roBERTa) libraries. The data used is obtained from Twitter via the SNScrape library, which aided in the retrieval of over 700,000 tweets via the search terms #chatgptsecurity, #chatgpthackers, #chatgptcybersecurity, and #chatgptcyberthreats. The analysis of the results by the VADER model shows 43.8% positive, 36.3% neutral, and 19.9% negative sentiments. Similarly, the roBERTa model shows 14.1% positive, 53.2% neutral, and 32.7% negative. These results show that there is an ongoing concern about ChatGPT and cybersecurity, especially in malware code generation, hacking, intelligence gathering, and phishing attacks.}

abstract = {Background
Adolescence is a critical period for lifelong health, which makes access to accurate and comprehensive sexuality education essential. As video platforms become a primary source of information for adolescents, the quality of their content significantly impacts their physical and mental health.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the quality, reliability, understandability, and actionability of adolescent sexuality education videos on major Chinese platforms (Bilibili, TikTok or Douyin, and Kwai), analyze associated user comment sentiment and topics, identify predictors of quality and reliability, and provide recommendations.
Methods
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted (April 2025) on the top 100 comprehensively ranked comprehensive sexuality education videos (N=300 total) retrieved from each platform using the keyword 青春期性教育 (“adolescent sexuality education”). Videos were assessed using the Global Quality Score, modified DISCERN, and Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT-U/A), with interrater reliability assessed via Cohen κ. A corpus of over 49,000 user comments underwent sentiment analysis (fine-tuned RoBERTa) and topic modeling (BERTopic, yielding 29 topics grouped into 6 themes). Statistical analyses included Kruskal-Wallis H tests, Spearman correlations, and stepwise linear regressions (SPSS [version 27.0]; P<.05).
Results
Video quality and reliability were moderate on Bilibili and TikTok but generally poor on Kwai. Content from verified sources (physicians, educators, and institutional media) demonstrated superior quality and stability compared to highly variable content from individual media (the predominant source type, especially on Kwai; 87/100, 87%). Paradoxically, Kwai exhibited the highest user engagement despite the lowest quality scores. Understandability (PEMAT-U) was consistently the strongest positive predictor for both quality (Global Quality Score, final model adjusted R2=0.383, β=0.485) and reliability (modified DISCERN, final model adjusted R2=0.209, β=0.319). Actionability (PEMAT-A) and video duration were also significant positive predictors. Understandability scores (PEMAT-U) were generally high (approximately 69%), while actionability scores (PEMAT-A) were moderate to low (33%-50%). Sentiment analysis revealed that comments were predominantly neutral (35,372/49,680, 71.2%), with negative comments (9141/49,680, 18.4%) significantly outweighing positive ones (5167/49,680, 10.4%). Key discussion themes identified included sources of knowledge acquisition, sexual safety and prevention, physiology, and sexual health and practices.
Conclusions
While online video platforms offer accessible channels for adolescent sexuality education in China, the current content is often of moderate-to-poor quality, with questionable reliability and limited actionability. Understandability is paramount, but high engagement does not necessarily correlate with high quality or reliability, potentially amplifying misinformation. To effectively empower youth, critical steps include enhancing content quality by adhering to evidence-based frameworks like the International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education; strengthening platform accountability through improved verification and algorithms; and promoting user media literacy. These measures aim to foster a healthier and more equitable future for Chinese adolescents, helping to achieve goals related to sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy prevention and promoting more open societal attitudes toward sexuality.}

TikTok is a popular social media platform where individuals make and share short videos, including activity challenges. Younger generations comprise the majority of TikTok users and are more impressionable to impersonate these challenges. The challenges range in severity of potential hazard, with the Benadryl challenge being one of the high-risk challenges. Case Details: Here, we report a case of a 14-year-old female who presented with a seizure from diphenhydramine (Benadryl) overdose following participation in the TikTok Benadryl Challenge.
Discussion
One of the more common reasons why people participate in the challenges is for a sense of belonging. Physicians and parents should learn the motivation behind engagement to help facilitate conversations and educate adolescents on the safety of the different social media challenges.
Conclusion
It may be beneficial to assess motivation behind participation in social media challenges in patients with pre-existing mental health conditions and those without in order to ascertain possible differences in risk factors. As healthcare professionals, it is essential to emphasize to parents and other caregivers the importance of supervising kids’ use of social media and that inappropriate use can lead to life-threatening situations or long-term negative effects.}

TikTok has become one of the trending social media platforms with beauty content within its application. Somethinc is one of the brands that is being viewed mostly on this application. This study aims to better understand the influence of eWOM by virtue of the TikTok application on purchase intention of Somethinc. To understand the influence of eWOM, we applied the information adoption model as the model had been widely used in previous eWOM studies. The information quantity variable was added to the information adoption model. We collected data from 403 respondents administered through a Google Form survey that had several criteria. PLS-SEM using Smart PLS was chosen for data analysis. We found that information adoption positively and significantly influences purchase intention. The model was able to predict the purchase intention of Somethinc accurately by 21.1%.}

Medical providers use the short-form video social media platform TikTok to share information related to their scope of practice and insights about their professions. Videos under the hashtag #occupationaltherapy on TikTok have over 100 million views, but there is no evidence investigating how occupational therapy information and knowledge are shared on the platform.
Objective
The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to describe TikTok content with the hashtag #occupationaltherapy and investigate how occupational therapy is portrayed.
Methods
We performed a content analysis on the top 500 TikTok videos under the hashtag #occupationaltherapy. We analyzed occupational therapy content themes (occupational therapy intervention, education, student training, universal design, and humor), practice settings (pediatrics, generalists, dementia, hand therapy, neurology, occupational therapy students, older adults, mental health, and unknown), and sentiments (positive, negative, and neutral).
Results
The videos in our sample (n=500) received 175,862,994 views. The 2 most prevalent content areas were education (n=210) and occupational therapy interventions (n=146). The overall sentiment of the videos was positive (n=302). The most frequently observed practice settings in the videos were pediatrics (n=131) and generalists (n=129). Most videos did not state that it was occupational therapy (n=222) or misused the hashtag (n=131).
Conclusions
TikTok has the potential for occupational therapists to share innovations, build communities of practice, and engage in collaborative efforts to share information about occupational therapists’ unique roles with diverse populations. Future research is needed to monitor the quality of information and debunk inaccuracies.}

keywords = {misinformation, vaccine, online community, influencer, echo chamber, Taiwan},
abstract = {Background
Prevalence and spread of misinformation are a concern for the exacerbation of vaccine hesitancy and a resulting reduction in vaccine intent. However, few studies have focused on how vaccine misinformation diffuses online, who is responsible for the diffusion, and the mechanisms by which that happens. In addition, researchers have rarely investigated this in non-Western contexts particularly vulnerable to misinformation.
Objective
This study aims to identify COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, map its diffusion, and identify the effect of echo chamber users on misinformation diffusion on a Taiwanese online forum.
Methods
The study uses data from a popular forum in Taiwan called PTT. A crawler scraped all threads on the most popular subforum from January 2021 until December 2022. Vaccine-related threads were identified through keyword searching (n=5818). Types of misinformation, including misleading, disinformation, conspiracy, propaganda, and fabricated content, were coded by 2 researchers. Polarity was proposed as a proxy for measuring an individual’s level of involvement in the echo chamber, one of the mechanisms responsible for the viral misinformation on social media. Factors related to information diffusion, including misinformation type and polarity, were then assessed with negative binomial regression.
Results
Of 5818 threads, 3830 (65.8%) were identified as true information, and 1601 (27.5%) contained misinformation, yielding 5431 boards for analysis. Misinformation content did not vary much from other contexts. Propaganda-related information was most likely to be reposted (relative risk: 2.07; P<.001) when comparing to true information. However, the more polarized a user was, the less likely his or her content was to be reposted (relative risk: 0.22; P<.001). By removing the nodes with a high level of indegree, outdegree, and betweenness centrality, we found that the core network and the entire network demonstrated a decreasing trend in average polarity score, which showed that influential users contributed to the polarization in misinformation consumption.
Conclusions
Although the forum exhibits a resilience to echo chambering, active users and brokers contribute significantly to the polarization of the community, particularly through propaganda-style misinformation. This popularity of propaganda-style misinformation may be linked to the political nature of the forum, where public opinion follows “elite cues” on issues, as observed in the United States. The work in this study corroborates this finding and contributes a data point in a non-Western context. To manage the echo chambering of misinformation, more effort can be put into moderating these users to prevent polarization and the spread of misinformation to prevent growing vaccine hesitancy.}

Postpartum individuals may be especially susceptible to body image dissatisfaction, with pressure to “bounce back” to their pre-pregnancy shape and weight, yet there is limited understanding of the type of appearance-related content these individuals are exposed to on social media sites such as TikTok. To better characterize this content, we conducted a content analysis of TikTok videos (N = 286) using #PostpartumBody. We evaluated participant characteristics as well as the presence of positive and negative appearance-related messaging. A lack of diversity was observed among videos, with the majority being coded as White and in the “healthy” body mass index range. Fifty-one percent of the videos had themes related to positive body image, over half involved negative body image themes (e.g., glorifying weight loss), and about one-quarter of videos included both positive and negative themes. The results of this study increase our understanding of both postpartum and appearance-related TikTok videos found on social media. Aligned with the effects of other appearance-related social media content, the type of content shared under the #PostpartumBody hashtag may contribute to poorer body image and psychological health during the postpartum period. Additional research to explore the effects of viewing this content is needed.}

TikTok serves as a social media platform for fostering social empowerment and facilitating community discussions. Recent research indicates that autistic adults use TikTok to share insights into their diagnoses. Adding to this line of inquiry, the current study examines the diagnostic journey of autistic women as shared on TikTok.
Method
Personal narratives of autistic women regarding their diagnostic experiences as shared on TikTok were identified and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2021) to inductively identify shared themes.
Results
Data related to theme I (i.e., “I have spent my whole life trying to fix myself”), II (i.e., “No one realized I was struggling”), and III (i.e., “This isn’t how it should be”) was consistent with other research examining the experiences of autistic women in their diagnostic journey. Theme IV (i.e., “You know yourself better than anyone”) provided unique findings with regard to the TikTok community. Specifically, content creators used TikTok as a platform for communal discourse and social empowerment. They provided and sought reciprocal support and direction.
Conclusions
Autistic women are turning to TikTok to share experiences and express perspectives. The data informs professionals on how to support women in their journey toward understanding themselves within an autistic identity.}

Disinformation on social media can seriously affect mental health by spreading false information, increasing anxiety, stress, and confusion in vulnerable individuals, as well as perpetuating stigma. This flood of misleading content can undermine trust in reliable sources and heighten feelings of isolation and helplessness among users.
Objective
This study aimed to explore the phenomenon of disinformation about mental health on social media and provide recommendations to mental health professionals that would use social media platforms to create educational videos about mental health topics.
Methods
A comprehensive analysis conducted on 1000 TikTok videos from more than 16 countries, available in English, French, and Spanish, covering 26 mental health topics. The data collection was conducted using a framework on disinformation and social media. A multilayered perceptron algorithm was used to identify factors predicting disinformation. Recommendations to health professionals about the creation of informative mental health videos were designed as per the data collected.
Results
Disinformation was predominantly found in videos about neurodevelopment, mental health, personality disorders, suicide, psychotic disorders, and treatment. A machine learning model identified weak predictors of disinformation, such as an initial perceived intent to disinform and content aimed at the general public rather than a specific audience. Other factors, including content presented by licensed professionals such as a counseling resident, an ear-nose-throat surgeon, or a therapist, and country-specific variables from Ireland, Colombia, and the Philippines, as well as topics such as adjustment disorder, addiction, eating disorders, and impulse control disorders, showed a weak negative association with disinformation. In terms of engagement, only the number of favorites was significantly associated with a reduction in disinformation. Five recommendations were made to enhance the quality of educational videos about mental health on social media platforms.
Conclusions
This study is the first to provide specific, data-driven recommendations to mental health providers globally, addressing the current state of disinformation on social media. Further research is needed to assess the implementation of these recommendations by health professionals, their impact on patient health, and the quality of mental health information on social networks.}

Our study also identifies that number of danmaku and number of people sending danmaku play a partial mediating role between user interactions and live streaming sales. Furthermore, we find that user sentiment plays a positive moderating role in the relationships between several flow variables and user purchase behavior. Theoretically, our study proposes a new method to empirically analyze user behavior in live streaming e-commerce. Practically, in light of these findings, we propose several optimization strategies to enhance the interaction functions of live streaming commerce, so as to enhance user experience and stimulate purchase intention.}

Against this background, this study aims to investigate how Chinese wanghong women craft their identities in their self-branding videos on the leading social commerce platform of TikTok. A framework is developed to model their projected identities as evaluative attributes and to elucidate how the identities are constructed using verbal and visual resources. A multimodal content analysis of a corpus of 1258 videos posted by 6 top-ranked wanghong women on TikTok shows that their identities are defined in terms of three marketable attributes: (1) the celebrity self, in which they highlight their glamorous appearance, aspirational lifestyle, and social responsibility, (2) the entrepreneur self, which includes their accentuation of their professionalism and self-empowerment, and (3) the ordinary woman self, in which they emphasize their intimate relationship with their consumer-audience on the one hand, and construct a cheerful and amiable self-image on the other. The multi-faceted identities shed new light on the evolving Chinese femininity shaped by the entangled forces of the development of the neoliberal social commerce and wanghong economy in China on the one hand, and the unique socio-political context on the other hand.}

A key social networking site for teachers, TikTok offers a new and valuable lens on educator attrition. This study aims to explore social media’s role in the increased transparency around leaving the profession and the online narratives crafted around transitioning out of the classroom.
Design/methodology/approach
Drawing on the conceptual framework of emergent storytelling and a recursive thematic analysis of videos and comments posted to the #teacherquittok hashtag on TikTok, this study examines how teachers are using social media to share their experiences of exiting the classroom.
Findings
The authors find that teachers used TikTok to share personal accounts that form a meta-narrative that provides context to their decisions to leave, share stories of loss and gain through negotiating the transition out of the classroom and finally debate the implications for preservice teachers. The authors discuss key takeaways for rethinking teacher support, teacher education and the role of social media in teachers’ professional lives.
Originality/value
While many studies seek to understand teacher attrition, this work examines how teachers’ stories shared on social media may be shaping attrition into an increasingly networked and narrated act.}

Energy drinks (EDs) are not recommended for minors' consumption due to a myriad of health risks, but marketing initiatives persist. This study explored the promotion of EDs on TikTok, a platform frequented by children and adolescents.
Methods
197 highly viewed videos from the four top ED-related hashtags on TikTok were coded for engagement variables, user information, sponsorship status, video content, and sentiment toward EDs.
Results
Of the 197 videos analyzed (combined 70 + million views), 29% disclosed sponsorship and 22% featured a child/adolescent. ED consumption appeared in 46% of videos, with 15% depicting hazardous consumption. Most videos (67%) had a positive sentiment toward EDs.
Discussion
ED-related TikTok videos are positively framed, have high engagement, and are not restricted for viewing by minors. As the platform's underage user-base grows, such videos may encourage heightened consumption. Given the known health risks, effective age-gated content restrictions are needed to reduce minors' exposure.}

Employing social network analysis, PageRank, and Superedge Rank methodologies, this investigation evaluates how TikTok users—called TikTokers—address climate change and its impact on social media. The assessment scrutinizes climate-related news, disasters, and the resultant networks to gauge the influence wielded by social influencers in disseminating messages. Results reveal that among the four key entities—internet influencers, government, scientists, and producers—internet influencers exert the most substantial influence on climate change news dissemination on TikTok, while the government plays an influential role in climate disasters. Like other social media platforms, TikTok is a valuable arena for gauging public sentiment on critical health concerns like global warming.

abstract = {Background
TikTok (ByteDance) experienced a surge in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic as a way for people to interact with others, share experiences and thoughts related to the pandemic, and cope with ongoing mental health challenges. However, few studies have explored how youth use TikTok to learn about mental health.
Objective
This study aims to understand how youth used TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic to learn about mental health and mental health support.
Methods
Semistructured interviews were conducted with 21 youths (aged 12-24 years) living in British Columbia, Canada, who had accessed TikTok for mental health information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded, and analyzed using an inductive, data-driven approach.
Results
A total of 3 overarching themes were identified describing youth’s experiences. The first theme centered on how TikTok gave youth easy access to mental health information and support, which was particularly helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic to curb the effects of social isolation and the additional challenges of accessing mental health services. The second theme described how the platform provided youth with connection, as it gave youth a safe space to talk about mental health and allowed them to feel seen by others going through similar experiences. This helped normalize and destigmatize conversations about mental health and brought awareness to various mental health conditions. Finally, the last theme focused on how this information led to action, such as trying different coping strategies, discussing mental health with peers and family, accessing mental health services, and advocating for themselves during medical appointments. Across the 3 themes, youth expressed having to be mindful of bias and misinformation, highlighting the barriers to identifying and reporting misinformation and providing individualized advice on the platform.
Conclusions
Findings suggest that TikTok can be a useful tool to increase mental health awareness, reduce stigma, and encourage youth to learn and address their mental health challenges while providing a source of peer connection and support. Simultaneously, TikTok can adversely impact mental health through repetitive exposure to mentally distressing content and misleading diagnosis and treatment information. Regulations against harmful content are needed to mitigate these risks and make TikTok safer for youth. Efforts should also be made to increase media and health literacy among youth so that they can better assess the information they consume online.}

Then we use weights quantified by sentiment lexical strength to enhance attention learning in final training, which enables our model to continue to focus on the active context words in different positions and eliminate the effects of the misleading context ones. Experiments on three datasets show that our approach can improve sentiment analysis performance and verify attention weights can be used as an explanation for text classification.}

Despite the public health importance of vaping and the widespread use of TikTok by adolescents and young adults, research is lacking on the nature and scope of vaping content on this networking service.
Objective
The purpose of this study is to describe the content of TikTok videos related to vaping.
Methods
By searching the hashtag #vaping in the discover feature, ~478.4 million views were seen during the time of data collection. The first 100 relevant videos under that hashtag were used in this study. Relevance was determined by simply noting if the video was related in any way to vaping. Coding consisted of several categories directly related to vaping and additional categories, including the number of likes, comments, and views, and if the video involved music, humor, or dance.
Results
The 100 videos included in the sample garnered 156,331,347 views; 20,335,800 likes; and 296,460 comments. The majority of the videos (n=59) used music and over one-third (n=37) used humor. The only content category observed in the majority of the videos sampled was the promotion of vaping, which was included in 57 videos that garnered over 74 million views (47.5% of cumulative views). A total of 42% (n=42) of the 100 videos sampled featured someone vaping or in the presence of vape pens, and these videos garnered over 22% (>35 million) of the total views.
Conclusions
It is necessary for public health agencies to improve understanding of the nature and content of videos that attract viewers’ attention and harness the strength of this communication channel to promote informed decision-making about vaping.}

Anxiety in university students can lead to poor academic performance and even dropout. The Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale (AMAS-C) is a validated measure designed to assess the level and nature of anxiety in college students.
Objective
The aim of this study is to provide internet-based alternatives to the AMAS-C in the automated identification and prediction of anxiety in young university students. Two anxiety prediction methods, one based on facial emotion recognition and the other on text emotion recognition, are described and validated using the AMAS-C Test Anxiety, Lie and Total Anxiety scales as ground truth data.
Methods
The first method analyses facial expressions, identifying the six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) and the neutral expression, while the students complete a technical skills test. The second method examines emotions in posts classified as positive, negative and neutral in the students' profile on the social network Facebook. Both approaches aim to predict the presence of anxiety.
Results
Both methods achieved a high level of precision in predicting anxiety and proved to be effective in identifying anxiety disorders in relation to the AMAS-C validation tool. Text analysis-based prediction showed a slight advantage in terms of precision (86.84 %) in predicting anxiety compared to face analysis-based prediction (84.21 %).
Conclusions
The applications developed can help educators, psychologists or relevant institutions to identify at an early stage those students who are likely to fail academically at university due to an anxiety disorder.}

We investigated the potential for these algorithms to exacerbate eating disorder symptoms by analysing 1.03 million TikTok videos delivered to 42 individuals with eating disorders (76 % anorexia nervosa) and 49 healthy controls over one month. Within this video corpus, we identified four video categories relevant to eating disorder psychopathology: appearance-oriented videos, dieting videos, exercise videos, and toxic eating disorder (akin to “pro-anorexia”) videos. Multi-level models predicted the likelihood of users’ algorithms delivering these videos and the likelihood of users “liking” (i.e., volitionally engaging with) these videos. Algorithms belonging to users with eating disorders delivered more appearance-oriented (+146 %), dieting (+335 %), exercise (+142 %), and toxic eating disorder videos (+4343 %). Stronger biases in users’ algorithms toward these videos were associated with more severe eating disorder symptoms. Whilst users with eating disorders were slightly more likely to “like” these problematic video categories (e.g., dieting videos: +23 % versus controls), their algorithms were far more likely to deliver these videos in the first place (dieting videos: +335 % versus controls). Our results provide preliminary evidence that the TikTok algorithm might exacerbate eating disorder symptoms via content personalisation processes that are desensitised to volitional user actions (i.e., “liking” videos).}

abstract = {Background
The proliferation of health-related content on social media platforms has changed the way people access and interpret information about cosmetic medicine. TikTok (ByteDance) has become an important platform for sharing breast enhancement content, yet little is known about the quality, credibility, and impact of such information on user perceptions and decision-making.
Objective
This paper aims to analyze the characteristics of breast enhancement videos, including uploader demographics, product details, promotional claims, and user engagements, to better understand the nature of the claims and products encountered by users.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional content analysis of the top 150 most-liked breast enhancement videos via TikTok’s web interface. The videos were coded according to the uploader’s traits (gender expression and account type), product details (type and scientific evidence), and promotional strategies (testimonials and sponsorship disclosures). Engagement metrics (likes and shares) were recorded, and nonparametric tests (Mann–Whitney U test) were used to compare the engagement between licensed physicians and uncertified content creator uploaders. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all the variables.
Results
Overall, 85 videos were included in the final analysis, with most uploaders presenting a feminine gender expression (59/85, 69.4%) and using uncertified content creator accounts (59/85, 69.4%). The most promoted product types were breast enhancement creams or oils (32/85, 37.6%) and breast implants (22/85, 25.9%). Most videos (71/85, 83.5%) depicted the products positively; however, most videos (78/85, 91.8%) provided no scientific evidence of the product’s efficacy. Engagement metrics revealed that videos by licensed physicians received significantly higher thumbs up (median 9761, IQR 4975-19,492) than uncertified content creator uploaders (median 701, IQR 280‐2604; P=.002). Only one video (1.2%) of the 85 videos included a “before and after” visual component, and most videos (75/85, 88.2%) omitted product purchasing details. Sponsorship disclosures were absent in most of posts (79/85, 92.9%).
Conclusions
TikTok’s short video format fosters widespread and rapid dissemination of breast enhancement information, representing a key strength in democratizing health communication. Its user-friendly interface and visual appeal also offer a valuable avenue for medical professionals to engage audiences more dynamically. However, the lack of rigorous content checks can amplify misleading or unverified claims. To address these weaknesses, implementing dual-mode content review could be essential for maximizing TikTok’s capacity to support informed public health decision-making.}

However, there is a scarcity of systematic research presenting the Chinese public's sentiments regarding the “substituting plastic with bamboo” policy. With the increasing use of social media platforms for expressing views on policies, this research employs web crawler technology to collect public data from TikTok, Bilibili, and Sina Weibo, and uses statistical analysis and text mining techniques for investigation. The findings indicate that public discourse is strongly influenced by the announcement of related national policies. Commonly identified keywords in the analysis include “plastic bag,” “cut,” “chopsticks,” “moldy,” “single use,” “garbage,” and “buy.” Sentiment analysis reveals that neutral sentiments account for more than one-third of all comments, with positive sentiments marginally outnumbering the negative ones. The negative sentiments predominantly express concerns about the quality and cost of bamboo wares, environmental repercussions, and policy implementation challenges. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic analysis, six key topics were identified based on Coherence and Jensen-Shannon Divergence metrics: economic environmental impact, the feasibility of substitution, impact on daily life, utilization of bamboo wares, production challenges, and policy implications. This research concludes with several policy recommendations. The insights gained from this research can assist the Chinese government and bamboo ware manufacturers in understanding market dynamics and in crafting more effective policies and strategies.}

To fill this gap, we analyze the most liked abortion videos on TikTok three months following the U.S. Supreme Court decision Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.
Study design
We downloaded the top 200 most liked, publicly available TikTok videos when searching “abortion” on September 26, 2022 and recorded and summarized key video characteristics. We then qualitatively analyzed for content, tone, and common themes.
Results
The top 200 most liked TikTok videos collectively had approximately 164 million likes, nearly 10 million shares, and 4 million comments. Most videos expressed support for abortion and presented information that was political or personal in nature. Only two videos contained health information about obtaining or completing an abortion, and only five videos featured or were created by a medical provider.
Conclusions
Findings reveal the far reach of TikTok, which underscores the importance of analyzing online sources of information about abortion. However, our mixed-methods analysis indicates that the most liked TikToks are a source of abortion news, political opinion, personal stories, and debate rather than a source of health information for abortion seekers.
Implications
Our analysis finds that the top 200 most liked TikTok videos three months post-Dobbs are primarily political in nature. Relatively few videos provided practical information about accessing abortion care, presenting an opportunity for healthcare providers, public health advocates, and activists to improve access and awareness of new pathways to care. The most popular TikTok videos appear to disseminate news and political information rather than health information about abortion.}

abstract = {Objective
To investigate themes, quality, and reliability of gynecologic cancer-related content on the social media application TikTok.
Methods
TikTok was systematically searched for the 100 most popular posts for ovarian cancer (OC), endometrial cancer (EC), cervical cancer (CC), vulvar cancer (VC), and gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) in August 2022. Data was collected for demographics, tone, and themes. Educational videos were rated for quality and reliability utilizing the modified DISCERN scale. Relationships between content demographics, disease sites, and themes were assessed.
Results
As of August 2022, the top five hashtags for each gynecologic cancer on TikTok had 466.7 million views. 430 of the top 500 posts were eligible for inclusion (OC: n = 86, CC: n = 93, EC: n = 98, GTD: n = 63, VC: n = 90). The majority of creators (n = 323, 75.1%) were White, 33 (7.7%) were Black, 20 (4.6%) were Asian/Pacific Islander (API), 10 (2.3%) were South Asian, 20 (4.7%) were Hispanic/Latino/a, 24 (5.5%) were unable to determine. Eleven central themes were identified, with significant differences when analyzed by disease site and race. The median DISCERN score for all posts was 1.0, indicating poor educational quality and reliability. When compared by race, South Asian/API posters received the highest scores (3, IQR 2.5) versus Black (2: IQR 3), Hispanic/Latino/a (2: IQR 0), and White posters (1, IQR 2) (p = 0.0013).
Conclusion(s)
Gynecologic cancer-related content on TikTok is of poor educational quality, and racial disparities in gynecologic cancer extend to social media. Opportunities exist to create more diverse content to support racial and cultural experiences in gynecologic cancer treatment.}

A mixed-method approach is applied, incorporating the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model to analyze how content features influence users’ emotional reactions and engagement behavior, comparing UGC and BGC. A total of 3471 posts from 2014 to 2024 were analyzed. The results show that UGC significantly outperforms BGC in terms of engagement, particularly content shared by nanoinfluencers and personal profiles, while official institutional posts recorded the lowest levels of interaction. Sentiment and emotion analysis revealed that negative sentiment and emotional tones, such as sadness and happiness, generated higher engagement than positive or neutral content. Additionally, image-based content performed better than videos, especially on the official profile. These findings emphasize the potential of UGC as a powerful tool for brand promotion in the gastronomy sector and the importance of emotional relevance in social media strategies. This dual analysis provides insights into how Catalan gastronomy is promoted and perceived online, examining the interplay between official narratives and user interactions to assess how social media shapes a cohesive and authentic gastronomic identity, with strategic implications for tourism boards and policymakers.}

abstract = {Background
There are many effective treatment options for substance use disorder (SUD), yet most individuals with SUD do not seek formal treatment services. Given the rising popularity of TikTok and need to foster innovative means through which to attract and engage individuals with SUD with treatment, we sought to characterize how TikTok users in SUD recovery are using this platform to bolster their recovery support and/or give hope to others who are struggling with substance use.
Methods
Our sample consisted of 82 of the most liked TikTok videos related to attempts to cut down on or abstain from substances and/or strengthen SUD recovery. We employed an iterative process to codebook development resulting in codes for demographics, user-sentiment, video type, and mechanisms of recovery-related behavior change. Videos were independently double-coded and evaluated for inter-rater reliability.
Results
Video in this sample were heavily viewed, accounting for over 2 million views per video and 325,000 likes on average. Most common video themes were sharing a journey from active SUD to recovery (40.2%) and sharing/celebrating a recovery milestone (37.8%), followed by recurrence of substance use (12.2%). Commonly exemplified mechanisms of recovery-related behavior change included embracing a strong social identity as a person in recovery (81.7%), social support (45.1%), and participation in rewarding alternative activities (39.0%).
Conclusion
TikTok SUD recovery-focused videos can potentially reach millions with portrayed themes similar to established therapeutic mobilizers and mechanisms. More research is needed to better understand whether digital recovery narratives can effectively normalize experiences of addiction and help-seeking behaviors.}

abstract = {Background
TikTok is a popular social media platform that allows users to create and share content through short videos. It has become a place for everyday users, especially Generation Z users, to share experiences about their reproductive health. Owing to its growing popularity and easy accessibility, TikTok can help raise awareness for reproductive health issues as well as help destigmatize these conversations.
Objective
We aimed to identify and understand the visual, audio, and written components of content that TikTok users create about their reproductive health experiences.
Methods
A sampling framework was implemented to narrow down the analytic data set. The top 6 videos from each targeted hashtag (eg, #BirthControl, #MyBodyMyChoice, and #LoveYourself) were extracted biweekly for 16 weeks (July-November 2020). During data collection, we noted video characteristics such as captioning, music, likes, and cited sources. Qualitative content analysis was performed on the extracted videos.
Results
The top videos in each hashtag were consistent over time; for example, only 11 videos appeared in the top 6 category for #BirthControl throughout the data collection. Most videos fell into 2 primary categories: personal experiences and informational content. Among the personal experiences, people shared stories (eg, intrauterine device removal experiences), crafts (eg, painting their pill case), or humor (eg, celebrations of the arrival of their period). Dancing and demonstrations were commonly used in informational content.
Conclusions
TikTok is used to share messages on myriad reproductive health topics. Understanding users’ exposure provides important insights into their beliefs and knowledge of sexual and reproductive health. The study findings can be used to generate valuable information for teenagers and young adults, their health care providers, and their communities. Producing health messages that are both meaningful and accessible will contribute to the cocreation of critical health information for professional and personal use.}

abstract = {TikTok, one of the most popular visual social media platforms, has been criticized for perpetuating and glorifying eating disorders. In response, content focused on body positivity (loving your body) is growing on TikTok. However, body positivity content on other social platforms promotes positive body image but also perpetuates unrealistic beauty ideals. Body neutrality (deemphasizing the focus on the body's appearance) is an alternative concept that could portray less harmful content, but has yet to be explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore and compare the content under #BodyPositivity and #BodyNeutrality on TikTok. One hundred and fifty TikToks under each hashtag were downloaded. A thematic analysis of the TikToks was conducted. Three themes were generated that captured content across both hashtags, with only minor differences in content between the two: (1) Resisting societal ideologies (with subtheme: Normalizing insecurities), (2) (Re)producing disordered content (with subtheme: Toxic (body) positivity promotes the need for neutrality), and (3) Social critique. Within the themes, there was the promotion of body positivity through self-love and body acceptance, but also content that continued to emphasize standard beauty ideals and the thin-ideal. Certain TikToks provided educational content that explained the roots of the #BodyPositivity movement and what #BodyNeutrality means as a potentially more realistic approach to body acceptance. Findings suggest that #BodyNeutrality may provide a safer space for individuals online, and future research should assess the impact of such TikToks on those viewing them to assess body and eating attitudes and behaviours.}

As social media platforms gain popularity, their usage is increasingly associated with cyberbullying and body shaming, causing devastating effects.
Objective
This study aims to investigate the impact of social media on Generation Z users’ body image satisfaction. More specifically, it examines the impact of TikTok on body image satisfaction among TikTok users aged between 17 years and 26 years in Indonesia.
Methods
The methodology used mixed-method approaches. Quantitative data were obtained from 507 responses to a questionnaire and analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modeling. Qualitative data were obtained from the interviews of 32 respondents and analyzed through content analysis.
Results
This study reveals that upward appearance comparison is influenced by video-based activity and appearance motivation. Conversely, thin-ideal internalization is influenced by appearance motivation and social media literacy. Upward appearance comparisons and thin-ideal internalization comparisons detrimentally impact users’ body image satisfaction.
Conclusions
The results of this study are expected to provide valuable insights for social media providers, regulators, and educators in their endeavors to establish a positive and healthy social media environment for users.}

The rise of social media platforms, in particular, has sparked growing concern over their impact on individual behaviour, political discourse, and the management of personal data. These concerns have led to mounting institutional pressure from governments and the public, especially around issues of content curation, moderation, and data security. Responding to such pressures is complex for platforms, as they operate across multiple jurisdictions with overlapping yet often contradictory institutional demands. This paper investigates the institutional pressures faced by social media platforms in host-country contexts, focusing on their influence over users through content moderation and data governance. It examines how these platforms deploy nonmarket strategies to navigate these challenges, using TikTok's operations in the US market as a case study. The findings reveal that despite persistent scrutiny from the US government, TikTok has employed a range of nonmarket actions. These include direct actions such as enhancing content moderation and pursuing legal avenues, as well as indirect approaches like mobilising its user base. This study offers insights into the unique political challenges social media platforms encounter in host-country contexts and highlights the platform-specific strategies they develop to address these pressures.}

We further examine the association between knowledge construction phases and manually coded video characteristics. Overall, the classifiers suggest that comments predominantly serve social, non-knowledge-construction purposes, followed by sharing ideas, negotiating understanding, and exploring idea dissonance. Videos that focus on informational content, leverage original audio, and employ analytic language have higher proportions of comments that share and negotiate knowledge. We discuss considerations for science communicators, to develop content that encourages viewers to socially construct knowledge.}

abstract = {Background
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and imposes a significant economic burden. TikTok has risen as a favored platform within the social media sphere for disseminating CHD-related information and stands as a pivotal resource for patients seeking knowledge about CHD. However, the quality of such content on TikTok remains largely unexplored.
Objective
This study aims to assess the quality of information conveyed in TikTok CHD-related videos.
Methods
A comprehensive cross-sectional study was undertaken on TikTok videos related to CHD. The sources of the videos were identified and analyzed. The comprehensiveness of content was assessed through 6 questions addressing the definition, signs and symptoms, risk factors, evaluation, management, and outcomes. The quality of the videos was assessed using 3 standardized evaluative instruments: DISCERN, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmarks, and the Global Quality Scale (GQS). Furthermore, correlative analyses between video quality and characteristics of the uploaders and the videos themselves were conducted.
Results
The search yielded 145 CHD-related videos from TikTok, predominantly uploaded by health professionals (n=128, 88.3%), followed by news agencies (n=6, 4.1%), nonprofit organizations (n=10, 6.9%), and for-profit organizations (n=1, 0.7%). Content comprehensiveness achieved a median score of 3 (IQR 2-4). Median values for the DISCERN, JAMA, and GQS evaluations across all videos stood at 27 (IQR 24-32), 2 (IQR 2-2), and 2 (IQR 2-3), respectively. Videos from health professionals and nonprofit organizations attained significantly superior JAMA scores in comparison to those of news agencies (P<.001 and P=.02, respectively), whereas GQS scores for videos from health professionals were also notably higher than those from news agencies (P=.048). Within health professionals, cardiologists demonstrated discernibly enhanced performance over noncardiologists in both DISCERN and GQS assessments (P=.02). Correlative analyses unveiled positive correlations between video quality and uploader metrics, encompassing the positive correlations between the number of followers; total likes; average likes per video; and established quality indices such as DISCERN, JAMA, or GQS scores. Similar investigations relating to video attributes showed correlations between user engagement factors—likes, comments, collections, shares—and the aforementioned quality indicators. In contrast, a negative correlation emerged between the number of days since upload and quality indices, while a longer video duration corresponded positively with higher DISCERN and GQS scores.
Conclusions
The quality of the videos was generally poor, with significant disparities based on source category. The content comprehensiveness coverage proved insufficient, casting doubts on the reliability and quality of the information relayed through these videos. Among health professionals, video contributions from cardiologists exhibited superior quality compared to noncardiologists. As TikTok’s role in health information dissemination expands, ensuring accurate and reliable content is crucial to better meet patients’ needs for CHD information that conventional health education fails to fulfill.}

For this purpose, we propose a novel method for analyzing customer sentiment from online videos on product review. Firstly, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) modeling is applied to identify the topics from the online videos after data preprocessing. Then sentiment polarity corresponding to each topic of each speaker in videos can be identified using our newly designed multi-attention bi-directional LSTM (BLSTM(MA)), which can better mine complex relationships among a speaker’s sentiments on different topics. This paper is of great practical value for company managers and researchers to better understand a large number of customer opinions on specific products.

TikTok is a social media platform where patients can access and share information about intrauterine devices (IUDs). The primary objective of this study was to identify prominent themes of creators’ experiences with IUDs on TikTok.
Methods
We conducted a quantitative and qualitative assessment of eligible videos that appeared when searching for “IUD” on the TikTok platform between July 2019 and August 2022. Eligible videos contained content relevant to IUDs and were spoken and/or written in English.
Results
Of the 354 videos that met inclusion criteria, the majority were created by users without healthcare expertise (77%) and mentioned personal experiences with IUDs (68%). However, videos that were educational (27%) or created by users with healthcare expertise (23%) averaged more likes and views than other video types. Common content areas included IUD insertion (45%), side effects (31%), and removal (25%). Perceived gaps in knowledge about the insertion procedure and feeling that providers did not adequately prepare patients for the procedure contributed to dissatisfaction with IUD insertion and motivated creators to share their experiences on TikTok. Video creators often relied on information that they found on TikTok to educate themselves about the IUD insertion process and expressed frustration at unacceptable levels of pain during insertion.
Conclusion
Healthcare providers should be aware that adolescent patients who use TikTok have likely seen videos depicting negative experiences with IUDs and be prepared to address patients’ concerns, particularly regarding IUD insertion. Additionally, healthcare providers may use TikTok to educate users about IUDs.}

abstract = {Background
Handwashing has long been promoted to maintain health and in preventing disease transmission. One of the most valuable ways to convey messages related to handwashing is through visual display, such as video for educational purposes and to enhance learning. Social media is an important and popular way to disseminate messages to a wide audience.
Methods
In this cross-sectional, descriptive study, two hashtags, #WashYourHands and #SafeguardSplash were used to select the sample of 100 from available TikTok videos. In order to code each video, the same coding categories were used for both hashtags, including (1) wetting and rinsing hands (2) lathering soap (3) time used for scrubbing (4) drying hands (5) mentions COVID-19 (6) mentions using hand sanitizer instead of soap (7) mentions how germs spread (8) mentions key times to wash hands (9) and actual depiction of washing hands. Additional descriptive categories were coded as well. The observations recorded were tabulated and descriptive statistics were performed. Independent one-tailed t-tests (α = .05) were calculated to determine if a video's hashtag had a significant association with its garnered views, likes, and/or comments.
Results
In total, the 100-video sample received 1,990,834,567 views, 40,355,468 likes, and 173,422 comments. Despite the fact that each hashtag made up an equal proportion (50%) of the total sample, videos with #WashYourHands accounted for 93.3% of the total views. Coverage of the important steps involved in handwashing, such as drying hands, was minimal as was relevant background information.
Conclusion
The results indicate that while this opportunity is being realized to some degree, the majority of videos did not cover topics related important concepts of hand hygiene. Given the high engagement of younger audiences with TikTok, this could be a powerful mechanism for demonstrating and encouraging proper handwashing, especially in a population with low rates of handwashing.}

With emerging platforms like TikTok providing experientially immersive content, the role of digital storytelling in stimulating public engagement and emotions remains underexplored. Drawing from narrative persuasion theory and visual storytelling literature, the current study proposes an integrated framework to examine the storyteller, visual frame, and digital presentation characteristics of TikTok videos in predicting social-mediated public engagement and emotional reactions surrounding a recent natural disaster, the 2023 Maui Wildfire. Using visual content analysis and computational methods, the study analyzed 526 TikTok videos and 59,950 associated comments. Results showed that audiovisual vividness consistently predicted all three types of disaster engagement. In contrast, storyteller type, storytelling frame, and other presentation characteristics inconsistently predicted information consumption intention, information sharing intention, and emotional reactions on TikTok.}

abstract = {Background
Social media posts that portray vaping in positive social contexts shape people’s perceptions and serve to normalize vaping. Despite restrictions on depicting or promoting controlled substances, vape-related content is easily accessible on TikTok. There is a need to understand strategies used in promoting vaping on TikTok, especially among susceptible youth audiences.
Objective
This study seeks to comprehensively describe direct (ie, explicit promotional efforts) and indirect (ie, subtler strategies) themes promoting vaping on TikTok using a mixture of computational and qualitative thematic analyses of social media posts. In addition, we aim to describe how these themes might play a role in normalizing vaping behavior on TikTok for youth audiences, thereby informing public health communication and regulatory policies regarding vaping endorsements on TikTok.
Methods
We collected 14,002 unique TikTok posts using 50 vape-related hashtags (eg, #vapetok and #boxmod). Using the k-means unsupervised machine learning algorithm, we identified clusters and then categorized posts qualitatively based on themes. Next, we organized all videos from the posts thematically and extracted the visual features of each theme using 3 machine learning–based model architectures: residual network (ResNet) with 50 layers (ResNet50), Visual Geometry Group model with 16 layers, and vision transformer. We chose the best-performing model, ResNet50, to thoroughly analyze the image clustering output. To assess clustering accuracy, we examined 4.01% (441/10,990) of the samples from each video cluster. Finally, we randomly selected 50 videos (5% of the total videos) from each theme, which were qualitatively coded and compared with the machine-derived classification for validation.
Results
We successfully identified 5 major themes from the TikTok posts. Vape product marketing (1160/10,990, 8.28%) reflected direct marketing, while the other 4 themes reflected indirect marketing: TikTok influencer (3775/14,002, 26.96%), general vape (2741/14,002, 19.58%), vape brands (2042/14,002, 14.58%), and vaping cessation (1272/14,002, 9.08%). The ResNet50 model successfully classified clusters based on image features, achieving an average F1-score of 0.97, the highest among the 3 models. Qualitative content analyses indicated that vaping was depicted as a normal, routine part of daily life, with TikTok influencers subtly incorporating vaping into popular culture (eg, gaming, skateboarding, and tattooing) and social practices (eg, shopping sprees, driving, and grocery shopping).
Conclusions
The results from both computational and qualitative analyses of text and visual data reveal that vaping is normalized on TikTok. Our identified themes underscore how everyday conversations, promotional content, and the influence of popular figures collectively contribute to depicting vaping as a normal and accepted aspect of daily life on TikTok. Our study provides valuable insights for regulatory policies and public health initiatives aimed at tackling the normalization of vaping on social media platforms.}

abstract = {Objectives
To investigate themes, quality, and reliability of cervical cancer (CC) related Spanish-language content on TikTok as compared to English-language content.
Methods
TikTok was systematically searched for the top 200 Spanish-language and 100 English-language posts for CC in August 2024. Data were collected including creator demographics, timing of posts in relation to diagnosis, tone, intent, and themes. The modified DISCERN, a validated tool including structured questions assessing reliability and of health-related resources was utilized to assess videos with educational intent. Differences were assessed.
Results
There were more physician Spanish-language creators (27.8 %) compared to physician English-language creators (11.00 %, p < 0.001). Most Spanish-language education videos were created by physicians (82.25 %). Spanish-language posts were more likely to feature themes of treatment toxicities (7.5 % vs 1.7 %, p < 0.001), faith (3.7 % vs 0.7 %, p = 0.003), pain (2.0 % vs 0 %, p = 0.001), family support (1.6 % vs 0 %, p = 0.004), hair loss (1.8 % vs 0.3 %, p = 0.039), and long-term treatment sequelae (1.4 % vs 0 %, p = 0.007); and less likely to address themes of diagnosis (11.8 % vs 18.0 %, p < 0.001), fear or anxiety about cancer (3.4 % vs 8.2 %, p = 0.002), impact on sexual function (0.6 % vs 6.1 %, p < 0.001) and parenthood (0 % vs 3.7 %, p < 0.001). The median DISCERN score was 1.42 (Interquartile Range [IQR] 1.33–1.67) and 1.33 (IQR 1.00–1.92), for Spanish and English-language posts, respectively (p = 0.385).
Conclusions
There were significantly more Spanish-language physician creators suggesting a strong interest in physician-driven content. Thematic differences between Spanish-language and English-language posts highlight important differences in experiences. CC-related content is of poor educational quality, regardless of language. Improving TikTok educational content could increase CC awareness and prevention.}

abstract = {Background
Social media platforms that are based on the creation of visual media, such as TikTok, are increasingly popular with adolescents. Online social media networks provide valuable opportunities to connect with each other to share experiences and strategies for health and wellness.
Objective
The aim of this study was to describe the content of the hashtag #mentalhealth on TikTok.
Methods
This cross-sectional, descriptive content analysis study included 100 videos with the hashtag #mentalhealth on TikTok. All videos that included the hashtag #mentalhealth were analyzed and coded for the presence of content categories. Additionally, the comments to each video were viewed and coded for content in the following themes: offering support or validation; mentioning experience with suicide or suicidal ideation; mentioning experience with self-harm; describing an experience with hospitalization for mental health issues; describing other mental health issues; and sharing coping strategies, experiences of healing, or ways to feel better.
Results
Collectively, the 100 videos studied received 1,354,100,000 views; 266,900,000 likes; and 2,515,954 comments. On average, each video received 13,406,930.69 (SD 8,728,095.52) views; 2,657,425.74 (SD 1,449,920.45) likes; and 24,910.44 (SD 21,035.06) comments. The only content category observed in most (51/100, 51%) of the videos included in the sample was “general mental health.” The remaining content categories appeared in less than 50% of the sample. In total, 32% (32/100) of the videos sampled received more than the overall average number of likes (ie, more that 2.67 million likes). Among these 32 videos, 23 (72%) included comments offering support or validation and 20 (62%) included comments that described other mental health issues or struggles.
Conclusions
With over 1 billion cumulative views, almost half of the assessed TikTok videos included in this study reported or expressed symptoms of mental distress. Future research should focus on the potential role of intervention by health care professionals on social media.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this study was to characterize COVID-19 content posted by users and disseminated via TikTok, a social media platform that has become known largely as an entertainment platform for viral video-sharing. We sought to capture how TikTok videos posted during the initial months of the COVID pandemic changed over time as cases accelerated.
Methods
This study is an observational analysis of sequential TikTok videos with #coronavirus from January to March 2020. Videos were independently coded to assess content (e.g., health relatedness, humor, fear, empathy), misinformation, and public sentiment. To assess engagement, we also codified how often videos were shared relative to their content.
Results
We coded 750 videos and approximately one in four videos tagged with #coronavirus featured health-related content such as featuring objects such as face masks, hand sanitizer, and other cleaning products. Most videos evoked “humor/parody,” whereas 15% and 6% evoked “fear” and “empathy”, respectively. TikTok videos posted in March 2020 had the largest number of shares and comments compared with January and February 2020. The proportion of shares and comments for “misleading and incorrect information” featured in videos was lower in March than in January and February 2020. There was no statistical difference between the share and comment counts of videos coded as "incorrect/incomplete" and "correct" over the entire time period.
Conclusions
Analyzing readily available social media platforms, such as TikTok provides real-time insights into public views, frequency and types of misinformation, and norms toward COVID-19. Analyzing TikTok videos has the potential to be used to inform public health messaging and public health mitigation strategies.}
