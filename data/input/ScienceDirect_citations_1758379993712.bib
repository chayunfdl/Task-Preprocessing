abstract = {In social media, remaining authentic while taking advantage of monetizing opportunities is a key dilemma for online content creators—the creator’s dilemma. Individuals typically start as small-scale creators, creating the content they enjoy. As they grow, the temptations of monetization increase, creating tension with their sense of authenticity. This can affect how genuine their content appears, potentially altering how they and others perceive their authenticity. Five in-depth interviews with mega-creators (content creators with more than one million followers) provide qualitative insights into how this dilemma can evolve and what strategies creators use to balance authenticity and monetization. The interviewed creators suggest three strategies, by moving (1) from paid advertising to co-creation with brands, (2) from staging content to improvising content, and (3) from producing content to growing their own creator brand. This non-representative and conceptual discussion motivates future research into the creator’s dilemma.}

LSC is typical online-offline producer-customer intermediation type of the platform urbanism. Based on unique data from Huitun on the LSC activities in Taobao (Alibaba), we trace how digital streamers/platform with their own geographies connect suppliers with customers from different regions. Most digital streamers are located in urban areas, so they form a kind of urban intermediation among different regions. We argue that digital streamers, product suppliers, and customers form new urban systems because of their relational work and intermediation. We also show how intermediary cities emerge and change their positions in the new urban system. We demonstrate that retail is no longer based on the traditional service radius within a city but on a function of the intermediation of customers and suppliers from different regions. Finally, we provide evidence indicating that market access, transport infrastructure, and market consumption capacity are important factors that help explain such positions.}

abstract = {Background
Live-streaming e-commerce has emerged as a dynamic shopping medium, engaging consumers through interactive and immersive experiences. “Keeping Consumers in Suspense” (KCIS), encompassing preview fuzziness, suspense setting, and delight creation, is widely used to drive engagement and impulse buying. Still, its impact on consumer inner states and behaviors remains underexplored.
Objective
This study examines the influence of KCIS on consumer impulse buying behavior, focusing on the mediating roles of value perception and expectation perception.
Methods
Data were collected from 352 active users of Chinese live-streaming platforms using a structured survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) tested the relationships among KCIS dimensions, inner states, and impulse buying. A bootstrapping analysis with 5000 iterations assessed the stability and significance of mediating effects, supported by validity and reliability tests of newly developed KCIS constructs.
Results
Preview fuzziness (β = 0.35, p < 0.01) and suspense setting (β = 0.48, p < 0.01) significantly influenced value and expectation perception, while delight creation primarily affected expectation perception (β = 0.34, p < 0.01). Expectation perception mediated the relationship between KCIS and impulse buying more strongly (β = 0.35, p < 0.01) than value perception (β = 0.15, p < 0.05). Bootstrapping confirmed the robustness of these mediation effects.
Conclusion
KCIS strategies play a pivotal role in shaping consumer behavior in live-streaming e-commerce by influencing impulse buying through mechanisms such as value and expectation perception. The results highlight the effectiveness of preview fuzziness, suspense setting, and delight creation in enhancing consumer engagement and driving sales. These findings provide practical guidance for streamers to design tailored suspense tactics that maximize impact. Future research should extend this framework to diverse cultural contexts to validate its generalizability and explore additional influencing factors.}

To address these gaps, we propose a novel Multimodal Dynamic Prediction Framework that integrates Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) for capturing multimodal dynamics in live-commerce forecasting. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our framework outperforms baseline approaches significantly. Key findings include: (1) Elucidation of a novel dual-track evolution of KOL influence, characterised by high sensitivity and rapid decay in emerging markets versus gradual penetration and sustained impact in mature markets. (2) Identification of core cyclical patterns underpinning the live streaming restructuring of traditional retail. (3) Temporal variation in multimodal feature contributions confirms an inverted U-shaped relationship between cognitive load and information digestion efficiency. Our framework provides actionable insights for precision marketing and dynamic KOL allocation, advancing both theory and practice in global e-commerce.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Background
Resistance exercise is considered first-line management for lateral elbow tendinopathy (LET). TikTok enables sharing of short-form videos with algorithms distributing videos with higher engagement (e.g., views/likes).
Purpose
To assess resistance exercise video quality for LET on TikTok between general users and self-identified health care professionals and explore associations between engagement and video quality.
Study Design
Social media review using a systematic review framework.
Methods
TikTok was searched using five hashtags. Included videos were in English and focused on resisted exercise. Creator and video engagement metrics were extracted, with viewing index and engagement rate calculated. The DISCERN and Tennis Elbow Exercise Education Score (TEEES) were used to assess video quality. A Kruskal-Wallis test examined differences between general users and self-identified health care professionals and Spearman’s rho (rs) correlations explored associations between video quality and engagement metrics. Median (interquartile range) were reported.
Results
Ninety-eight videos were included with no significant differences in engagement between general users and self-identified health care professionals. Overall, resistance exercise video quality was poor with no significant differences between general users (DISCERN 26 [22-29] out of 75, TEEES 8 [5-10] out of 25) and self-identified health care professionals (DISCERN 25 [21-27], TEEES 7 [5-9]; p = 0.37 and p = 0.35, respectively). Video quality was weakly correlated with video likes, favourites, and viewing index (rs = 0.23, p = 0.03; rs = 0.23, p = 0.02; rs = 0.21, p = 0.04, respectively).
Conclusions
The quality of resistance-based exercise videos for LET on TikTok was poor, regardless of user profile. While some engagement metrics were associated with video quality, viewers should not rely on these metrics to indicate video quality.}

Across 39 countries, different tools and tactics, from high heels to grenade launchers, were resorted to harm and to expose >96 animal species in nearly 50 h of online animal cruelty content. Monetized by 155 advertisers, 114 videos amassed over US $1,14 million, benefiting 79 channels. ‘Wildlife as pets’ was most profitable and 38 of the identified species are listed in CITES appendices. Model-based insights revealed monetization's link to cruelty categories (especially Category 8, ‘Wildlife as pets’) and creators' gender (i.e., undetermined gender of content creator) parameters. Children were in 61 productions. Removals generated by YouTube correlated with cruelty Category 6 (Staged rescues), proving that the diligence of the platform in taking contents down is paramount for more or less monetization. We propose advertiser-imposed legal standards on social networks to compel content removal and that audience report crimes to police aiming legal penalization of animal cruelty content creators.}

By integrating the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT), and Uses and Gratifications Theory (UGT), this study addresses how perceived usefulness, ease of use, compatibility, and motivation jointly shape Gen Z's behavioral intentions and actual usage of TikTok for news. A survey of 859 Vietnamese respondents aged 16–27 demonstrated that motivations and intention to use TikTok are key drivers of actual usage, whereas perceived usefulness, ease of use, and compatibility positively influence intentions but do not directly predict usage behavior. These findings highlight that Gen Z's news engagement with TikTok arises from a blend of utilitarian perceptions, lifestyle alignment, and intrinsic motivations for entertainment and convenience. This study adds to the existing literature by focusing on Vietnam, a country with high digital penetration and a rapidly evolving media ecosystem, and provides practical insights for news organizations and educators. The results underscore the importance of aligning news content with Gen Z's mobile-first habits and the blurred lines between entertainment and reliable information in the short-form video era.}

The results show that, in the case of free product promotion, human agents are more effective at reducing consumer purchase hesitation. However, there is no significant difference in the impact of human agents and chatbots on purchase hesitation in the context of price discount promotions. Our findings indicate that psychological contracts mediate the impacts of sales promotions and communication agents on consumer purchase hesitation. This study solidifies the theoretical foundations regarding the impact of traditional and AI-assisted sales promotions on consumer psychology, ultimately leading to purchase hesitation.

Elaboration likelihood model (ELM) is applied to explore the viewers’ decision-making process via two distinct routes, comprised of central and peripheral routes. By integrating mindfulness as a moderator, this study develops a research model to examine the effects of central route factors (information completeness, information accuracy, and information currency) and peripheral route factors (streamer trustworthiness, streamer attractiveness, bullet-screen consistency, and co-viewer involvement) on perceived persuasiveness. The research results indicate, by using 395 valid empirical data, which both route factors exert significant effects on viewers’ perceptions of the persuasive message and lead to apropos behavior intentions. Mindfulness positively moderates the relationship between perceived persuasiveness and response intention. This investigation provides theoretical implications for the literature of live streaming commerce and ELM as well as managerial implications for live streaming commerce practitioners.}

Results demonstrate that, as a search engine, TikTok is perceived as less valuable than traditional search engines (e.g., Google) in terms of convenience, reassurance, independence, privacy, and functionality. Meanwhile, evaluative actions primarily focus on checking others’ comments and video elements rather than checking other official outside sources. Live-streaming and algorithm-driven recommendations significantly impact users’ perceived credibility of information found on TikTok and their sense of social presence. Algorithm-based recommendations also play a crucial role in shaping users’ trust in content and their verification behaviors. Contrary to expectations, meta-voicing (i.e., users’ engagement via the comment section and reactions) does not predict social presence, which hints at the need to refine existing affordance frameworks for short-form video platforms. Social presence and perceived source credibility, in turn, significantly predict information-seeking behaviors. Interestingly, higher perceived credibility leads to more evaluative actions being taken to reassess information found on TikTok. Empirically, the findings have implications for information literacy initiatives, platform design, and algorithmic transparency to understand users’ searching behaviors and how they evaluate information credibility on social media platforms. Theoretical implications of the findings, as well as limitations and suggestions for future research, are further discussed.}

Key findings include: (1) In high-commission environments, platforms and merchants are better aligned, increasing the likelihood of merchants adopting truthful advertising strategies. (2) In high-profit environments, the temptation for merchants to engage in false advertising rises, prompting platforms to adopt blockchain technology to maintain transparency. (3) Although blockchain technology adoption enhances platform reputation over the long term, its direct impact on merchants’ advertising strategies is limited. (4) Regulatory measures such as fines and consumer reporting rewards promote blockchain technology adoption and reduce false advertising. These findings provide valuable insights for enhancing the credibility of live-streaming e-commerce and offer guidance for platforms on balancing technology adoption with regulatory efforts to foster sustainable industry development.}

To systematically characterize and fact-check breastfeeding-related content on TikTok and assess its accuracy against established evidence-based recommendations.
Design
This study employed quantitative content analysis to examine TikTok videos tagged with #breastfeeding to quantify breastfeeding information patterns, engagement metrics, and creator types. Only videos sharing breastfeeding information in English (regardless of country) were included. Videos were coded using a predefined framework developed by the study authors.
Main Outcome Measures
Engagement metrics, creator type, and video accuracy.
Analysis
Interrater reliability was calculated using Cohen’s kappa. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the frequency of videos in each category. A 1-way analysis of variance was applied to assess differences in engagement between evidence-based, non-evidence-based, or misinformation videos. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed to analyze differences in engagement based on video accuracy.
Results
Of the 224 videos analyzed, 65% were classified as evidence-based, while 32% were non-evidence-based. Misinformation outperformed the other categories in shares, saves, and views. No significant differences in engagement metrics were found between evidence-based and non-evidence-based videos.
Conclusions and Implications
These findings offer insights into how breastfeeding information is portrayed on TikTok and may inform strategies to improve the dissemination of accurate, evidence-based content on social media platforms.}

The vast majority of social media advertising (93 %) was therefore non-compliant with UK advertising regulations and also EU consumer protection law. In the UK alone, the 93 most viewed TikTok adverts failing to disclose loot box presence were watched 292,641,000 times total or approximately 11 impressions per active user. Many people have therefore been repeatedly exposed to prohibited and socially irresponsible advertising that failed to provide important and mandated information. Implementation deficiencies with ad repositories, which must comply with transparency obligations imposed by the EU Digital Services Act, are also highlighted, e.g., not disclosing the beneficiary. How data access empowered by law can and should be used by researchers is practically demonstrated. Policymakers should consider enabling more such opportunities for the public benefit.}

abstract = {Objective
The study aimed to assess the influence of student-generated TikTok videos on quiz performance and to evaluate student perspectives on this tool for learning the top 300 drug facts.
Methods
This mixed-methods cohort study was conducted in Fall 2021 with second-year pharmacy (P2) students (n = 169). Students could create videos in small groups tasked with developing and viewing TikTok videos or use traditional study methods (top 300 drugs flashcards). Pre and poststudy surveys and focus groups assessed perceptions and demographics. Quiz performance was compared between TikTok creators, viewers, and nonparticipants using Kruskal-Wallis tests, with thematic analysis applied to qualitative data.
Results
The survey response rate was 94.1% (159/169). A total of 112 students watched TikTok videos to study (“viewers”; 70.4%), while 47 did not (“nonviewers”; 29.6%); 106 students created videos (“creators”; 66.7%), while 53 did not (“noncreators”; 33.3%). No significant difference in quiz scores was noted between TikTok viewers and nonviewers. Similarly, no significant difference in quiz scores was observed between TikTok creators and noncreators. Thematic analysis revealed that creating videos helped with understanding but was time-consuming, and viewing the videos for study purposes was reportedly distracting.
Conclusion
Student perceptions supported the educational value of TikTok videos, but neither producing nor watching significantly affected quiz performance. Although creating and viewing these videos had benefits, such as making studying more fun and accessible, there were also some limitations, including the laborious process of creating the videos and distractions.}

The data analysis based on the partial least squares path modelling and variance-based structural equation modelling (PLS- SEM) supports that the propensity to cross-cultural adaptation positively affects online viewers' cross-cultural adaptation. Meanwhile, the cross-cultural adaptation will positively influence online viewers' attitudes towards EMG cultural streaming, motivate their watching intention, and drive their final behavioural responses.

Moreover, perceived network size significantly predicted perceived enjoyment, social interaction, social presence, and utility. In addition, experience-focused shopping orientation mediated the relationships among perceived enjoyment, self-presentation, social interaction, and live-stream shopping intentions. Finally, the mediating roles of the perceptions of digital celebrities in the relationships of perceived network size with perceived utility, perceived engagement, social interaction, social presence, and self-presentation were confirmed.}

To test its hypotheses, the study estimates a fixed-effects regression model on a panel dataset of content creators collected using a web-scraping method. The findings indicate that as the frequency of creators' content sharing increases, user engagement behavior initially increases but then falls after reaching a peak, supporting the inverted U-shaped relationship. Moreover, creators' number of followers, number of following, and number of competitors negatively moderate the inverted U-shaped relationship.

An extensive dataset was assembled, comprising 4984 product introduction video segments from 768 TikTok livestreaming rooms in China, along with 1.29 million bullet screen comments and 513,551 viewers' information. Employing advanced multimodal data processing technologies, the study extracted anchors' (livestreaming hosts) multimodal emotion features. The empirical findings demonstrate the significant impact of anchors' emotions, encompassing body movements, facial expressions, voices, and conversation contents, on the arousal and valence of group emotions, where the latter exhibit opposing effects on instant order cancellation behavior. This research establishes the paramount roles of anchor and group emotions in viewers' instant order cancellation behaviors, lending credence to the epistemological applicability of emotional contagion theory in the context of LSE. The study's findings offer LSE practitioners practical implications to enhance business decision-making, fostering more engaging and emotionally resonant livestreaming experiences to reduce cancellations and improve customer retention.}

To address this challenge, understanding consumers' repurchase behavior has become crucial. While live commerce's interactive nature provides both instrumental and hedonic affordances, their distinct impacts on repurchase behavior remain underexplored. Drawing on self-determination theory (SDT), this study examines the underlying mechanisms through which affordances influence consumers' repurchase behavior in live commerce by fostering autonomy, relatedness, and swift guanxi. We adopted a mixed-methods approach with two complementary studies: Study 1 employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis of open-ended survey responses to identify and categorize live commerce affordances (instrumental vs. hedonic). Study 2 used a three-wave survey to test our hypotheses about these affordances' effects. Our results demonstrate that: (1) Instrumental affordances (guidance shopping, metavoicing, and visibility) enhance repurchase behavior by fostering autonomy; (2) hedonic affordances (visibility, novelty, and co-presence) promote repurchases through strengthened relatedness; (3) interestingly, swift guanxi negatively moderates the effect of autonomy on repurchase behavior, but not that of relatedness. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the dimensions and the roles of IT affordances in online marketplaces, offering actionable strategies for live commerce practitioners aiming to bolster customer retention.}

This paper develops a theoretical model to examine consumers’ purchasing and tipping behaviors, incorporating their social utilities during live streaming. Our findings show that product selling and virtual tipping in live streaming interact through the moderating effect of social utility. As the size of followers increases, manufacturers tend to lower product prices in live streaming to stimulate both purchasing and tipping behaviors. However, continuously reducing the price is not an optimal strategy. Additionally, we demonstrate that live stream selling represents a win-win option for both influencers and manufacturers compared to direct selling. Interestingly, influencers with relatively small follower bases are even willing to sell manufacturers’ products without charging a commission. These insights deepen the understanding of live stream selling and virtual tips, offering practical guidance for live streaming professionals to make informed strategic decisions.}

The results indicate that acknowledgement from the streamer is a significant positive predictor of viewers' willingness to gift (WTG). Further analysis reveals that the variable ‘gifting elasticity’ is also a significant predictor of WTG, implying that viewers who have pre-purchased coins are more likely to gift. These findings enhance our understanding of the motivations behind gifting in social media livestreams and highlight effective strategies that streamers can use to increase gifting. Additionally, they identify areas for improvement for platform designers. Existing literature in this field predominantly focuses on Asian consumers and social media networks. Therefore, this study is novel as it examines these motivations within the UK context, specifically targeting TikTok as the social media platform.}

These platforms are also dynamic, with shows or discussions changing quickly inside a room and users frequently switching between rooms. To improve user engagement and experience on such platforms, we design a new recommendation model named Dynamic Representations for Live Streaming Rooms (DRIVER) to provide room recommendations. Guided by the Integrated Framework for Consumer Path Modeling and the social affordance theory, DRIVER infers dynamic representations of live streaming rooms by leveraging users’ behavior paths in entering, staying in, and leaving rooms. One contribution of our model is a new and efficient dynamic learning framework to model instantaneous and ever-changing inter-room relationships by considering individual users’ behavior paths after leaving a room. Also supported by social affordance theory, another methodological novelty of our model is to capture dynamic characteristics of a room by incorporating features of the current audience inside the room. Experiments on real-world datasets from two different types of live streaming platforms demonstrate that DRIVER outperforms state-of-the-art representation learning methods and sequential recommender systems. The proposed method also has implications for recommender system design in other contexts, in which items are characterized by users’ dynamic behavior paths and ongoing social interactions.}

Drawing upon the uses and gratifications theory, social media engagement theory, and social identity theory, we conducted a survey with 565 participants in mainland China. The findings reveal that interactivity-based gratifications significantly influence both preliminary and further levels of engagement, while modality-based gratifications primarily impact preliminary engaging behaviors. Furthermore, user identification acts as a mediating factor in the relationship between affordance-based gratifications and engagement. These results offer valuable empirical evidence for scholars and practitioners to consider technological factors and streamers’ roles while examining user engagement on game live streaming platforms.

Addressing that limitation, this study applies socio-technical systems theory and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to investigate how social elements (beauty, humor, passion, expertise, warmth), technical features (interactivity, personalization), and customer value dimensions (hedonic, utilitarian) jointly drive or hinder customer-engagement behavior (CEB). Using data from 682 Indonesian viewers, the analysis reveals three configurations that lead to high CEB, all of which contain personalization + both customer-value dimensions, yet differ on the social side—showing, for example, that beauty or warmth can be absent without harming engagement when humor, passion, and expertise are present. Conversely, two absence-heavy recipes produce low CEB; notably, one reveals that even robust streamer cues and interactivity cannot rescue engagement when personalization and perceived value are lacking. These findings extend socio-technical systems theory by underscoring the intricate interdependence among social, technical, and value resources. Methodologically, fsQCA demonstrates a robust approach for examining nuanced, multi-factor influences. Practically, the study provides guidance for platforms and streamers—emphasizing the importance of balancing emotional appeal, interactive features, and customer-value dimensions—to maximize engagement in the fast-growing landscape of e-commerce live streaming.}

Nowadays, there has been no systematic discussion on enhancing product value through value co-creation. Based on the Social Exchange Theory (SET), and take the current new type of online community, the social live-streaming community, as the research object, this study investigates how Para-social Interaction (PSI) between users and streamers affects users' perceived benefits, whether perceived benefits are related to users' community commitment and the relationship between community commitment and CCB from the perspective of value co-creation. Three hundred and forty-seven valid samples from China were obtained using TikTok and subsequently analyzed via Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The analysis results show that PSI positively influences users' perceived benefits, and among the perceived benefits, hedonic and self-esteem benefits can positively influence users' community commitment. When users' community commitment to live-streamers exists, it can effectively incentivize users to develop CCB. Theoretically, research findings enrich the study of online community value co-creation, para-social interaction, and citizenship behavior and provide recommendations for operating social live-streaming platforms.}

Drawing on the source credibility theory and uncanny valley theory, the study employed a 2 (Vividness: High vs. Low) × 2 (Telepresence: High vs. Low) × 2 (Playfulness: High vs. Low) experimental design to examine how vividness, telepresence, and playfulness impact credibility, trust, familiarity, and ultimately repeat purchase intention. Utilizing data from 438 participants and employing PLS-SEM and fsQCA, the results reveal that vividness, telepresence, and playfulness positively affect credibility, trust, and familiarity, which drive repeat purchase intention. Additionally, credibility, trust, and familiarity also act as mediating variables to promote repeat purchase intention. The fsQCA results identify multiple sufficient configurations leading to high repeat purchase intention. The findings advance our understanding of consumer behavior in AI-mediated e-commerce interactions and offer actionable insights for enhancing AI digital human live streaming strategies.}

Short videos stimulate users’ senses through audiovisual content, offering both entertainment and disseminating information. However, the underlying mechanisms influencing consumer engagement behaviors remain largely unknown. By analyzing short video advertisements from TikTok, we find four key audiovisual features—namely, colloquial expression, cadence, colorfulness, and visual prominence—that are significantly correlated with consumer engagement behaviors. For the first time, we integrate these audiovisual features with the multimodal theory and the elaboration likelihood model, enriching the research literature on consumer perception. Furthermore, we discover the moderating effect of product types and release time. Methodologically, our feature extraction methods, based on machine and deep learning contribute to social media research, offering insights into how influencers can leverage the audiovisual elements of short videos to captivate users.}

However, current research mainly centers on live streaming in commerce and entertainment, overlooking its affordances for episodic learning. Drawing from classic vicarious learning (VL) paradigms, and considering the perspectives of social media affordances and parasocial interaction, we propose a theoretical model for examining VL in live streaming and address research gaps. The proposed theoretical model was tested and validated through a three-wave data collection survey (t1, N = 504; t2, N = 438; t3, N = 256) from four popular Chinese live-streaming platforms. The results reveal two main forms of VL (i.e., independent and coactive), which users engage in to enhance their knowledge adoption in live streaming. Parasocial interaction, on one hand, directly affects knowledge adoption in live streaming, while VL plays a partial mediating role in the effect. Moreover, both VL and parasocial interaction benefit from social media affordances (i.e., browsing others' content, communication, metavoicing, and relationship formation). More important, although knowledge consensus can strengthen the impact of VL on knowledge adoption, it negatively moderates the influence of parasocial interaction on knowledge adoption. Our study extends the applicability of VL to knowledge adoption in computer-mediated communication contexts (CMC) and provides practical suggestions for how social media practitioners and designers facilitate viewer learning behavior.}

Inspiration theory and optimum stimulation level theory are applied in a tourism context to examine how livestream viewers’ individual differences influence their inspiration for impulse buying and cross-buying. Further, sociomateriality is adopted to examine how the interconnectedness of livestreaming has an impact on inspiration and behaviours. Findings from in-depth interviews and an online survey of social media users who had livestreaming commerce experience indicate that impulse buying and cross-buying are driven by antecedents such as two-way communications between streamers and individuals and online communities and individuals, as well as the perception of inspiration. These relationships are moderated by the optimum stimulation level.

Broadcasters and viewers in the transaction-oriented category focus on products and transactions and tend to communicate with non-emotional words in live chats. In contrast, broadcasters and viewers might treat each other as friends and are more likely to post emotional words in the relationship-oriented category. Our econometric model shows a curvilinear association between relationship-oriented social interactions and viewer purchase behaviors. The empirical analysis indicates that to achieve higher sales, LSC broadcasters should make relationship-oriented social interactions in live chat account for 58.64% of the probabilities. We discuss the implications of heterogeneous social interaction strategies across different broadcasters.}

Users watch streamers’ performances and purchase virtual gifts for their favorite streamers. There are two types of streamers: non-contracted ones who stream independently and contracted ones who sign with and work for the platform. Based on observed industrial practice, the platform provides non-contracted streamers with a straight commission plan and contracted streamers with one of three alternative compensation plans, namely, the basic compensation plan (B-plan), salary-based incentive plan (SI-plan), and commission-based incentive plan (CI-plan). The platform first decides its compensation plans for two types of streamers, then the streamers decide their type and effort level. We explore and compare the streamers’ optimal decisions under different compensation plans. We interestingly find that the SI/CI bonus does not always motivate streamers to perform better. The SI bonus is only effective for the streamers whose ability is neither low nor high while the CI bonus can effectively motivate the majority of streamers except those having extremely low ability or some low-intermediate-ability streamers. In addition, the platform can screen out low-ability streamers and attract high-ability streamers to sign with it by properly designing its compensation plans. Finally, we examine managerial insights for the platform. We show that both SI-plan and CI-plan result in higher expected profits for the platform than the B-plan.}

TikTok is increasingly becoming a source of health information, peer support, and validation regarding mental health. The goal of this study was to analyze the content of TikTok videos related to depression and anxiety.
Methods
The sample included 100 videos, each with at least a million views, discussing either depression, anxiety, or both. The videos were retrieved from hashtag searches. The videos were coded for the type of mental health condition; specific content being discussed (e.g., symptoms or treatment); video presentation (i.e., personal experience, expert information, or general discussion), and more subcategories. Engagement statistics (i.e., likes, views, reposts, and number of comments) for each video were also recorded.
Results
The engagement statistics were higher for personal experience videos than for videos from healthcare professionals. Anxiety was the subject of 57% of the videos irrespective of the search hashtags, and over two-thirds of the videos were created by females. The most discussed topics included the description or enactment of depression/anxiety symptoms (e.g., emotional displays); mention of being diagnosed by a healthcare professional was the least prevalent.
Discussion
These results suggest that depression and anxiety videos featuring personal experiences are prevalent on TikTok with higher engagement compared to similar videos by health professionals. The attribution of generic symptoms to these mental health conditions may result in self-diagnosis. There is a need for more strategic efforts to ensure quality of health content on TikTok and increased focus on digital health literacy to make young social media users critical consumers of online content.}

Results
A total of 113 videos amongst 38 creators garnered 52,021,700 likes and 370,983 comments. Most videos focused on education (45.5%) and personal stories (22.7%). Creators were predominantly young females (82.0%), with minimal input from healthcare professionals (3% of videos). Sixty-nine (61%) of videos had responses with further questions.

Usefulness of hysteroscopic metroplasty to improve reproductive outcomes is controversial and debated among reproductive specialists and, consequently, patients.
Methods
We performed a cross-sectional analysis to assess the quality, reliability, and level of misinformation in YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok videos about hysteroscopic metroplasty. Videos on each social network retrieved using “hysteroscopy” and “septate uterus” or “uterine septum” as keywords were assessed using Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for audio-visual (PEMAT A/V) content, the modified DISCERN (mDISCERN), Global Quality Scale (GQS), Video Information and Quality Index (VIQI) and Misinformation assessment.
Results
One hundred fifteen videos (47 from YouTube, 35 from TikTok, and 33 from Instagram) were included. Median PEMAT A/V Understandability and Actionability scores were 50.0 % (IQR: 0–63.3) and 20 % (IQR: 0.0–50.0). Actionability was higher YouTube relative to TikTok and Instagram (50.0 % [IQR: 0–75.0] vs. 0 % [IQR: 0–66.0]; p < 0.001 and 0 % [IQR: 0–33.0], p < 0.001), with no significant differences for Understandability. Median mDISCERN was 3 (IQR: 0–3), with higher score for YouTube compared to TikTok and Instagram (3 [IQR: 0–3] vs. 0 [IQR: 0–23], p < 0.001 and 1 [IQR 0–3.0], p < 0.001 respectively). VIQI showed low-level content (median 9; IQR: 4–19) and no differences among social media platforms. GQS was low (median 2 [IQR 1–4.5]), with no differences in subgroup analysis. Videos on YouTube (97.9 %) and TikTok (62.9 %) favored hysteroscopic metroplasty, while Instagram content was against in 63.6 % of cases (p < 0.001). While most videos were found to be either completely or partially accurate, significant differences in misinformation levels were observed across platforms, with YouTube exhibiting the lowest rate of inaccuracies compared to TikTok and Instagram.

In this article, we explore the current research on influencing factors in live-streaming, to identify the state of the field and inform future research. A scoping review was conducted to map the currently researched topics and factors, to find emerging or understudied topics, and to analyze the state of multidisciplinary and multicultural cooperation. Two iterations of a literature search and a citation-based literature mapping were used to collect 348 peer-reviewed entries. Identified and classified themes were analyzed along with visualizations of the local citation network, concept co-occurrence, and an inter-country citation graph. As a result, the main actors, genres, and issues in live-streaming, the frequency with which they are researched, and their trends over time were identified and described. Games and esports dominate research; topics recently gaining interest are e-commerce, mental health, collaboration and teaching using streams, and promoting tourism using streams. The body of literature is well connected; scientific disciplines and research groups seem to be aware of each other. For future research, we recommend exploring non-gaming genres and hybrid events and pursuing interdisciplinary collaboration.}

abstract = {Live-streaming e-commerce is revolutionizing online retail by fostering real-time consumer engagement, yet limited research explores how streamer and platform characteristics jointly influence trust and drive consumer engagement behaviors (CEB). This study examines how streamer attributes (beauty, humor, passion, expertise, and warmth) and platform features (interactivity and personalization) shape trust in streamers and products, subsequently affecting CEB dimensions, including augmenting, co-developing, influencing, and mobilizing. Using data from 682 respondents and analyzing with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) via SmartPLS 4.0, the findings reveal that beauty and interactivity are pivotal for trust in streamers, while expertise and personalization are critical for trust in products. Trust in streamers emerged as the strongest predictor of CEB, emphasizing its role in fostering consumer loyalty and interaction. This research contributes to theory by integrating socio-technical perspectives with trust-based consumer engagement frameworks, offering a holistic understanding of trust to cultivate CEB. Practically, the study highlights the importance of employing streamers with strong interpersonal appeal and creating interactive, personalized shopping experiences to boost trust and engagement. The study advances live-streaming e-commerce by providing insights and presenting an original, trust-driven model for enhancing consumer engagement.}

Filmed in different styles and set to different music, these videos all feature parents caring for their children by acting upon their bodies as they insert, inject, remove, and reconfigure the biotechnologies of diabetes management. Building from recent studies that show that parents share the embodiment of their children's type 1 diabetes as stress and anxiety related to managing a potentially fatal condition, this article explores how parents use TikTok to visibilize interembodiment. In TikTok videos, interembodiment hinges on shared disease management rather than shared disease symptom or etiology. Moving from the position that people do not simply possess bodies but continually enact them, we explore how parents and children jointly enact diabetes through an entanglement of bodies, voices, medical technologies, and social media personae that appear in #diabetictoddler and #type1mom TikToks. Given some of these videos have circulated to millions of people, we propose that TikTok and other social media platforms provide unique forums for type 1 parents to make their interembodiment visible, perhaps even as a salve for the distress they suffer as they manage their children's illnesses.}

These qualities have positioned live streaming as a major venue for influencer marketing, where brands collaborate with influencers to promote products to engaged viewers. However, this study suggests that influencer marketing within live streaming may lead to a decline in viewership as viewers experience resistance toward sponsored content. Building on the persuasion knowledge model, we analyze this phenomenon using streaming data from Twitch.tv and apply propensity score matching (PSM) to assess viewership trends. Our findings reveal a significant decline in viewership associated with influencer marketing. We also identify strategies that streamers can employ to mitigate this negative impact. First, moderate levels of real-time interaction between streamers and viewers help alleviate viewership reduction. Second, streamers who diversify their content topics experience less viewership declines. Lastly, minimizing negative content reduces the adverse effect on viewership. These findings contribute to the literature on influencer marketing and live streaming, offering practical insights for firms and streamers aiming to enhance audience engagement.}

Prior research has examined factors driving viewers’ gifting decisions in a live streaming session. In this paper, we focus on the dynamics of payment behavior over time under PWYW. Based on individual-level observations of more than 60,000 viewers over a period of 165 days since their registration on a live streaming platform, we find a declining pattern in PWYW amount with the increase in individual tenure. We then propose and test several potential explanations, including variety seeking, alternative ways to interact, and substitution effect. The empirical results are consistent with the substitution effect that the cumulative spending in the past could crowd out the current PWYW amount, because viewers may believe that they have already contributed a significant amount. We further investigate several moderating factors for the overall negative effect of past spending. Besides contributing to the PWYW literature, our research would help firms understand the dynamics of individual PWYW behavior and design mechanisms to incentivize long-life customers to pay.}

Aided by technological platforms and AI tools, they form a complex and dynamic ecosystem of economic activity, estimated to be worth over $100 billion dollars, and growing rapidly. In this editorial we explore the creator economy from a marketing perspective, addressing questions such as: How can creators optimize their content, establish their brand, build their content composition, and expand their audience? How do platforms create the right mix of creators and curate their content? What challenges and opportunities are presented for traditional firms? We define the basic terminology and identify key stakeholders. We propose research questions related to creators, consumers, firms, and platforms, and discuss the implications for the marketing function within organization. A key insight of this editorial is that although content creators may appear to be a diverse group of individuals operating independently, their joint activity creates emergent patterns that can be monitored, monetized and managed strategically. To achieve this, research must develop suitable metrics and methodologies while adapting relevant marketing constructs. This editorial is accompanied by four research notes written by marketing scholars, who all learned first-hand from major players in the creator economy. Bleier et al. (2024) examine the role of social media platforms in enabling the creator economy. Hofstetter and Gollnhofer (2024) zoom into one of the most important dilemmas faced by creators on social media: balancing authenticity with monetization. Edeling and Wies (2024) also touch upon monetization in their focus on “creatrepreneurs,” entrepreneurs in the creator economy, and on the ecosystem that enables their activities.

abstract = {Purpose
The exponential growth of live streaming commerce has made it a prominent sales channel, yet limited research explores its impact from the perspective of retail atmospherics. This study aims to develop an integrated model examining how live streaming atmospherics influence consumers' post-purchase intentions. It specifically focuses on how consumer perceptions of expertise and time scarcity affect the cognitive processes leading to purchase behaviors.
Design
Grounded in the Stimulus–Organism–Response (S-O-R) framework, this study collected 842 valid survey responses to test its hypotheses. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to evaluate the relationships among live streaming atmospherics, perceived expertise, and consumer post-purchase intentions.
Findings
Results indicate that aesthetic cues and bullet screen mutuality are key dimensions of live streaming atmospherics that positively influence consumers' post-purchase intentions. Additionally, time scarcity strengthens the positive impact of perceived expertise on consumers' intentions to post comments and recommend products, highlighting its moderating role in consumer decision-making processes.
Originality
This study provides a novel perspective on the impact of live streaming atmospherics on consumer behavior, filling a research gap by integrating expertise perception and time scarcity into the S-O-R framework. Practical examples from prominent e-commerce platforms such as Taobao Live and JD Live are incorporated to demonstrate how aesthetic design and interactive features in real-world scenarios enhance consumer post-purchase behaviors.}

Accurate product return prediction is highly desirable for the vendors to optimize their business operations in advance to reduce return-related costs. This paper proposes a novel approach, called Contraformer (Contrastive transformer), to predict product returns in live streaming e-commerce by leveraging fine-grained streamer behavior features extracted from three modalities (i.e., visual, acoustic, and language). The primary contribution lies in that we adopt Transformer with the encoder-decoder architecture with a novel class-supervised contrastive learning (CSCL) to fuse streamer behavior for multimodal representation alignment and inter-modal interaction characterization. By using a real-world dataset with 2584 product streamers and 864 items collected from Tiktok China live streaming platform, we demonstrate that the proposed Contrasformer approach outperforms the baseline methods in predicting product return rate with a 25 % reduction in terms of mean absolute error. This study offers great managerial implications for vendors to manage their practice in live streaming commerce.}

Different from other social media, TikTok offers a new feature, namely TikTok Live, participants can use this social media for their entertainment as well as a buying and selling platform. At the same time, live streaming also faces several factors where consumers are not yet sure about buying it. However, the marketing strategy has recently become a hot topic of discussion. Therefore, this empirical research aimed to investigate why Indonesian consumers buy on live streaming using perceived trust as a mediating variable, such as trust in the products and trust in the sellers. The factors used to analyse the influence on consumers' purchase intention include utilitarian value, hedonic value and social value. This study collected data in a questionnaire created in Google Forms and performed data analysis using SPSS 26 and SPSS Amos software, using structural equation models to analyse validation and theoretical hypotheses. The results of this analysis are expected to provide knowledge to social commerce providers, especially in the area of live streaming. This study shows that perceived values such as utilitarian, hedonic and social values have a significant positive impact on purchase intention. Utilitarian value and social value both have a significant and positive influence on both consumer trust in the products and consumer trust in the platform, but not on hedonic value, where hedonic value only has a significant positive influence on trust in the platform, but an insignificant effect on trust in the product. Even though hedonic value has no influence on the product, sellers still need to provide a more pleasant atmosphere to attract the attention of users or consumers. And for further research, this study hopes to uncover additional elements that influence consumer behaviour on the TikTok live streaming platform.}

Using a more-than-human netnography method, 42 travel live streams, 36,800 real-time comments, and 36 interviews from travel live streamers were collected through three phases (pre, during and post live streaming). The findings show that TLS affordances provide opportunities to foster PSI through psychological, social, and technological dimensions, and thus develop parasocial acquaintances and conflicts. This study contributes to parasocial investigation and affordance literature by illustrating the relationship between technology affordance and participants’ behaviours in the TLS. It also uses a novel methodological approach known as key frame analysis to capture and analyse live streamed video footage. Practical implications are discussed for live streamers, destinations, and platforms.}

Based on nationally representative data (n = 7701) collected via Douyin, a leading live streaming e-commerce platform in China, the study adopts PLS-SEM to test how social presence of the streamer (SSP) and that of other viewers (VSP) affect consumers' purchase intention (PI). A comprehensive framework integrating SSP, VSP, loneliness (LN), and consumer experience (CE) is proposed to understand consumers' PI in the context of live streaming shopping. It is found that SSP, VSP as well as CE, have direct positive effects on consumers' PI. Different roles played by social presence of two social actors are identified. Specifically, SSP exhibits a more pronounced impact on both CE and consumers' PI compared to VSP. Notably, contrary to the role of SSP in alleviating consumers' LN, VSP is found to significantly intensify consumers' LN, which implies that digital coexistence of other viewers in the live streaming shopping context may not provide consumers with a positive sense of companionship. LN affects consumers' PI via a complete mediation effect of CE, underscoring the vital role of CE in shaping consumers' PI in the live streaming shopping context, which also implies potentially distinct internal processes between current context of concern and traditional offline contexts. Moderating effect analyses reveal that LN negatively moderates the total effects of SSP on both CE and PI, indicating LN may function as an inherent self-protective element during social interactions between consumers and the streamer in the live streaming shopping context. Managerial implications, limitations and suggestions for future research are also discussed at the conclusion of the paper.}

Quantifying user-user interaction with BERT model, we then perform a sentiment analysis using the Baidu API. The results of our analysis demonstrate that entertainment-type and information-type user interaction have a significant positive effect on flow, including user stay time, number of danmaku, number of people sending danmaku. Our study also identifies that number of danmaku and number of people sending danmaku play a partial mediating role between user interactions and live streaming sales. Furthermore, we find that user sentiment plays a positive moderating role in the relationships between several flow variables and user purchase behavior. Theoretically, our study proposes a new method to empirically analyze user behavior in live streaming e-commerce. Practically, in light of these findings, we propose several optimization strategies to enhance the interaction functions of live streaming commerce, so as to enhance user experience and stimulate purchase intention.}

A framework is developed to model their projected identities as evaluative attributes and to elucidate how the identities are constructed using verbal and visual resources. A multimodal content analysis of a corpus of 1258 videos posted by 6 top-ranked wanghong women on TikTok shows that their identities are defined in terms of three marketable attributes: (1) the celebrity self, in which they highlight their glamorous appearance, aspirational lifestyle, and social responsibility, (2) the entrepreneur self, which includes their accentuation of their professionalism and self-empowerment, and (3) the ordinary woman self, in which they emphasize their intimate relationship with their consumer-audience on the one hand, and construct a cheerful and amiable self-image on the other. The multi-faceted identities shed new light on the evolving Chinese femininity shaped by the entangled forces of the development of the neoliberal social commerce and wanghong economy in China on the one hand, and the unique socio-political context on the other hand.}

Further, this paper designs an incentive mechanism to attract consumers to participate in value co-creation under two live streaming sales modes and explores the impact of the incentive mechanism on live streaming sales mode selection. The results show that the brand chooses the traditional e-commerce mode when the total market size exceeds a certain threshold; otherwise, the brand can select the live streaming mode to create more value. Under the brand live streaming mode, providing incentive mechanisms to encourage consumer engagement in live streaming is beneficial for achieving value co-creation when the incentive level is below a certain threshold. Under the influencer live streaming mode, the brand shares incentive costs with the influencer instead of being conducive to value addition, i.e., the incentive cost should be borne by the influencer rather than the brand.}

Videos discussing characteristics of diagnoses, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), receive significant engagement. However, concerns have been raised about the spread of misinformation and potential self-diagnosis among viewers of these videos. To assess the accuracy of the information shared, we conducted a content analysis of 100 popular TikTok videos. Our findings showed that 55 % of the characteristics that youth attributed to ADHD in their videos did not align with the DSM-5-TR criteria of this diagnosis. Investigation of the top comments further suggests that the majority of the viewers (59,6 %) identified with the depicted behaviors and experiences. Moreover, most of the top-commenters accepted or even validated that these traits were part of ADHD, even though this was often not the case. Our findings illustrate how youth broaden the ADHD concept on TikTok. This bottom-up psychiatrization may affect the self-image of other young people who identify with this content, as they come to understand their own behaviors through a pathological lens. It additionally raises concerns about the already high demand for health care, as individuals may seek help after self-diagnosing. This study highlights the need to make health care providers, educators and parents aware of the misinformation circulating online about ADHD. This would enable them to better support youth and help them to be critical of mental health content they encounter on social media.}

abstract = {Live streaming has become an important approach for vendors to strategically promote their products. This study aims to understand the entire process of live-streaming shopping. Based on the information foraging theory, we identify relevant search (i.e., attractiveness and perceived product fit) and evaluation (i.e., vividness, mutuality, and price value) cues and assess how they influence consumers’ continuous watching and purchase intention. A survey was conducted, and 486 Chinese consumers were recruited. Our results show that search and evaluation cues influence consumers’ search experience (i.e., perceived enjoyment, perceived serendipity, and perceived diagnosticity), which ultimately results in continuous watching and purchase intentions. In addition to structural equation modeling, we also conducted a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify multiple pathways leading to search experience, continuous watching and purchase intentions. Our study contributes to the literature by developing a theoretical model explaining the whole process of live-streaming shopping. Our study also emphasizes the vital role of broadcasters (compared to co-viewers) and highlights the importance of serendipity. The results from the fsQCA also provide important strategic suggestions for practitioners regarding how to promote products via live streaming.}

Despite this, there remains a significant gap in understanding how streaming behaviors and co-playing relationships impact streamer popularity. This study addresses this gap by utilizing a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 450 thousand streamers from January 2020 to April 2023. We demonstrate that features derived from streaming and co-playing behavior can effectively forecast both short- and long-term popularity, achieving an AUC of 0.93 to 0.99. Our analysis indicates that streamer popularity is significantly impacted by the average number of followers and viewers, as well as their strategic positioning within the co-playing network, notably the number of weakly connected components. These findings elucidate strategies for streamers to attract and retain followers, enhancing their presence within the community. This research is the first to explore the influence of the live streamer co-playing network on popularity dynamics, revealing how interactions among online content creators can drive popularity beyond individual behaviors. Moreover, the insights gained can assist brands and businesses in collaborating with streamers more effectively, maximizing their influence and creating mutual value.}

UGC quality, including historical accumulated quality, impacts users’ consumption behaviour and advertising revenues. This study defines the value of UGC consumption based on content quality and price. We model the dynamic accumulation of historical values as value belief using differential equations. A differential game framework is employed to investigate the dynamic interplay between quality and advertising strategies for contributors and the platform. To address concerns about UGC quality, we introduce a user feedback mechanism that reflects post-engagement experiences and influences platform strategies. We investigate dynamic quality and advertising strategies within a decentralized UGC operational framework, both with and without the user feedback mechanism. The findings reveal that user feedback mitigates the negative effects of low-quality UGC and improves platform operational flexibility. Continuous advertising strategies may not always be beneficial, particularly when value belief is low. Furthermore, the user feedback mechanism exhibits different effects under varying subsidy and market potential scenarios. It helps sustain content quality in low-subsidy or unfavourable market conditions while amplifying profitability in high-subsidy or expansive markets. The platform can also determine content type strategies based on UGC period length. More continuous UGC generates short-term profits, whereas more decentralized UGC fosters long-term growth potential. These insights offer strategic guidance for platforms in determining operational models and premium content incentive schemes.}

However, the impact of consumers’ anticipated regret on decision-making within live streaming e-commerce remains insufficiently explored. This study introduces a novel analytical framework based on anticipated regret theory to analyze its effects on the live streaming supply chain. Demand functions for both retail and live streaming products are derived, and a game-theoretic framework incorporating both centralized and decentralized decision-making structures is developed, aiming to analyze the Manufacturer Self-operated (MSO) and Key Opinion Leader (KOL) live streaming models. To validate the proposed models, both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are conducted to explore the effects of anticipated regret on key operational variables, including pricing strategies, market demand, and firm profitability. Furthermore, a revenue-sharing contract is proposed that optimizes the performance of live streaming e-commerce supply chains by offering managerial insights into pricing strategies, live streaming tactics, and revenue allocation mechanisms, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of live streaming e-commerce. The results reveal three findings: (1) Consumers’ anticipated regret leads to reductions in retail, wholesale, and live prices. (2) Both live streaming service quality and KOL characteristic exhibits threshold effects on pricing and demand. (3) A properly designed revenue-sharing contract improves supply chain coordination and increases profit for both the manufacturer and retailer.}

abstract = {Objectives
The addiction of the student population to short-form video platforms such as TikTok (Douyin) is becoming increasingly apparent and is rapidly expanding. This emerging addiction is also believed to have negative impacts on students’ academic, social, and emotional well-being. Consequently, video addiction has become an important public health issue on campuses around the world. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between two types of TikTok addiction (video and live streaming) and social and emotional learning (SEL), including self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making.
Methods
Previous research has indicated that some students at vocational colleges become addicted to short-form videos. Accordingly, this study employed a snowball sampling method to survey students at vocational institutions across China. A total of 563 valid responses were obtained, yielding an effective response rate of 84.66%. The mean age of participants was 20.20 years old (SD = 1.36). Data were validated with structural equation modeling.
Results
Results showed that both video content addiction and live-streaming content addiction negatively correlated with all five dimensions of SEL. This also represents that all 10 hypotheses are valid and significant at p < 0.001. The effect sizes ranged from 0.48 to 0.54, which represents larger effect sizes. Notably, TikTok addiction showed the strongest explanatory power for self-awareness. This indicates that higher levels of addiction to either video or live-streaming content are associated with poorer performance across all facets of social and emotional learning, including self-awareness, emotion regulation, interpersonal relationships, sense of responsibility, and empathy.
Conclusion
This study found that TikTok addicts entered a state of ego depletion due to impaired self-regulation. This depletion then caused their subsequent self-control efforts during learning to fail. Our results also support the ego depletion theory, which posits that engaging in self-regulatory behaviors consumes limited self-control resources and can trigger a range of complex cognitive, emotional, and behavioral problems. This result also draws attention to the negative consequences of excessive use of short videos for social awareness and emotional performance.}

abstract = {Background
The proliferation of health-related content on social media platforms has changed the way people access and interpret information about cosmetic medicine. TikTok (ByteDance) has become an important platform for sharing breast enhancement content, yet little is known about the quality, credibility, and impact of such information on user perceptions and decision-making.
Objective
This paper aims to analyze the characteristics of breast enhancement videos, including uploader demographics, product details, promotional claims, and user engagements, to better understand the nature of the claims and products encountered by users.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional content analysis of the top 150 most-liked breast enhancement videos via TikTok’s web interface. The videos were coded according to the uploader’s traits (gender expression and account type), product details (type and scientific evidence), and promotional strategies (testimonials and sponsorship disclosures). Engagement metrics (likes and shares) were recorded, and nonparametric tests (Mann–Whitney U test) were used to compare the engagement between licensed physicians and uncertified content creator uploaders. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all the variables.
Results
Overall, 85 videos were included in the final analysis, with most uploaders presenting a feminine gender expression (59/85, 69.4%) and using uncertified content creator accounts (59/85, 69.4%). The most promoted product types were breast enhancement creams or oils (32/85, 37.6%) and breast implants (22/85, 25.9%). Most videos (71/85, 83.5%) depicted the products positively; however, most videos (78/85, 91.8%) provided no scientific evidence of the product’s efficacy. Engagement metrics revealed that videos by licensed physicians received significantly higher thumbs up (median 9761, IQR 4975-19,492) than uncertified content creator uploaders (median 701, IQR 280‐2604; P=.002). Only one video (1.2%) of the 85 videos included a “before and after” visual component, and most videos (75/85, 88.2%) omitted product purchasing details. Sponsorship disclosures were absent in most of posts (79/85, 92.9%).
Conclusions
TikTok’s short video format fosters widespread and rapid dissemination of breast enhancement information, representing a key strength in democratizing health communication. Its user-friendly interface and visual appeal also offer a valuable avenue for medical professionals to engage audiences more dynamically. However, the lack of rigorous content checks can amplify misleading or unverified claims. To address these weaknesses, implementing dual-mode content review could be essential for maximizing TikTok’s capacity to support informed public health decision-making.}

abstract = {In the realm of social livestreaming commerce, the enhanced interactivity relative to traditional e-commerce models induces considerable fluctuations in real-time orders. This variability necessitates the development of faster, more precise, and seamless order fulfilment processes to elevate customer satisfaction and foster long-term loyalty. As a leading platform in the social livestreaming commerce sector, TikTok has implemented a merchant experience rating system, which features the Logistics Experience Score (LES) to evaluate the logistics performance of its merchants. This study aims to explore the ways in which improving the order fulfilment processes can augment the logistics performance of merchants, with a particular focus on the LES as a primary metric. The research employed a two-phase design, consisting initially of surveys (N1 = 421) and subsequently, follow-up semi-structured interviews (N2 = 21) with TikTok merchants. The outcomes from the first phase underscore the pivotal role of IT infrastructure in enhancing the ‘order receipt’ and ‘pick and pack’ stages. Concurrently, Logistics Service Quality (LSQ) profoundly influences the ‘ship and transport’ and ‘order delivery’ stages. Most notably, the ‘ship and transport’ sub-process has emerged as a critical determinant impacting the LES, thereby underscoring its significance in shaping customer perceptions of logistics services. Findings from the second phase indicate that substantial improvements in the LES can be achieved through strategic investments in IT infrastructure and forging partnerships with reliable logistics providers. Such enhancements aim to increase the speed, efficiency, and reliability of shipping and transportation. Through these findings, this research contributes to the broader understanding of order fulfilment within the context of social livestreaming commerce, providing both theoretical and empirical insights that are valuable for merchants active in this field.}

Viewers of live streaming channels can interact with live streamers through various behaviors, such as sending virtual gifts and Danmaku. It is very critical to accurately model such viewers' behaviors, which reflect their interest, for recommending live streaming channels. However, existing studies on live streaming channel recommendation usually model viewers' interaction behaviors through traditional graphs where an edge only connects two nodes, which cannot capture interaction relationships between multi-viewers and multi-channels. In this study, we propose a novel approach to live streaming recommendation based on Viewers' Interaction Behavior Modeled by Hypergraphs (VIBM-Hyper). Specifically, VIBM-Hyper first constructs two hypergraphs to model viewers' interaction behaviors, including a channel-oriented behavior hypergraph and a viewer-oriented behavior hypergraph. Then, it employs a hypergraph convolution technique to learn the representations of viewers and live streaming channels, respectively, which are finally used to predict a viewer's preference for a certain live streaming channel. We analyzed viewers' multiple types of behaviors in live streaming channels and conducted empirical evaluation to investigate the effectiveness of VIBM-Hyper with two real-world datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate its superior performance in live streaming channel recommendation in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods.}

We then use SmartPLS software to test the proposed model by reference to survey data obtained from 330 Chinese live-stream shoppers. The results support all the hypothesized relationships, notably highlighting the negative moderating effect of brand popularity on the theoretical model proposed in this research. Necessary condition analysis (NCA) reveals that among the six independent variables investigated in this context, streamer persuasion quality has the greatest effect size. Additional analyses reveal that the weekly duration of live stream watching does not affect the relationships between the independent variables and perceived value; however, it does influence the interrelations among consumers’ psychological variables.

abstract = {Global digital platforms span diverse domains, from social media to online marketplaces, and wield significant influence within their respective sectors. The rise of social media platforms, in particular, has sparked growing concern over their impact on individual behaviour, political discourse, and the management of personal data. These concerns have led to mounting institutional pressure from governments and the public, especially around issues of content curation, moderation, and data security. Responding to such pressures is complex for platforms, as they operate across multiple jurisdictions with overlapping yet often contradictory institutional demands. This paper investigates the institutional pressures faced by social media platforms in host-country contexts, focusing on their influence over users through content moderation and data governance. It examines how these platforms deploy nonmarket strategies to navigate these challenges, using TikTok's operations in the US market as a case study. The findings reveal that despite persistent scrutiny from the US government, TikTok has employed a range of nonmarket actions. These include direct actions such as enhancing content moderation and pursuing legal avenues, as well as indirect approaches like mobilising its user base. This study offers insights into the unique political challenges social media platforms encounter in host-country contexts and highlights the platform-specific strategies they develop to address these pressures.}

This study investigates the roles of gratifications-sought, narcissism, and personality traits in TikTok engagement behaviors (i.e., contribution, enhancement, and creation) in China. Data were gathered from a sample of 526 TikTok users through an online questionnaire survey in 2020. Factor analysis confirmed nine gratifications sought: escape, fashion, entertainment, information seeking, money making, sociability seeking, navigability, modality, and interactivity. In particular, extraverts and people with the quality of being vain were most active in the contributing, enhancing, and creating TikTok engagement behaviors. The results also show that exhibitionists and people who are more open to new experiences were found to create more, while narcissists with an attitude of entitlement also engaging strongly in giving likes, commenting, forwarding TikToks, and following others. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.}

A total of 440 valid responses were collected from TikTok Shop users in Vietnam using a convenience sampling method. Data analysis and hypothesis testing were performed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) with SmartPLS version 4.0. The results showed that, except for the direct effects of information usefulness and quantity pressure, which were not statistically significant, all hypothesized relationships were supported. Additionally, the findings confirmed the moderating effect of financial capacity and the relevance of demographic controls in explaining impulsive buying behavior. The study offers insights for marketers and policymakers and provides recommendations for future research. This study also advances the theoretical understanding of consumer behavior in e-commerce by affirming psychological theories that link heightened emotional arousal to diminished self-control, thereby fostering impulsive purchasing.}

However, the literature on this topic is fragmented, lacking a cohesive foundation that hampers theoretical and empirical advancement. To address this gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review on impulse buying behavior in the context of live streaming e-commerce. Only peer-reviewed articles published in journals indexed in Web of Science or Scopus were considered. Our review synthesizes relevant findings from prior research across publication outlets, methodologies, theoretical frameworks, research contexts, and analyzed factors. We adopt the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model as an organizing framework, highlighting the key factors influencing impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce. The findings indicate that most research has relied on a cross-sectional survey design, predominantly conducted in Chinese contexts. Many researchers have employed the S-O-R framework; however, various other theoretical approaches have also been considered, depending on the key element under study (e.g., viewer, streamer, platform, or content of live streaming). Additionally, our findings identify a range of antecedents analyzed as different types of stimuli (e.g., marketing, streamer, live streaming, and others) and organismic factors (cognitive, affective, cognitive-affective, and personal traits). Finally, we propose a research agenda to guide future work and advance the field.}

Semi-structured interviews and observations are used as an interpretive paradigm with a comprehensive sample of 22 micro-celebrities and three managers and their presence in the live streaming industry in China. The findings show that: micro-celebrity status triggers role stress, and, in turn, role stress reinforces micro-celebrity status; and empty self and trans-parasocial interactions are two approaches that can be used to cope with role stress. The contribution made is threefold. Firstly, our study expands micro-celebrity literature by identifying the facets of their social media-afforded status in the context of live streaming in China. Secondly, our study contributes role theory by exploring three facets of micro-celebrity's role stress in live streaming in China. Thirdly, our study proposes that a micro-celebrity's stress, is a social phenomenon and its recognition helps our understanding of actively self- and socially-related coping approaches. We also provide managerial implications to better understand the micro-celebrity stress phenomenon and corresponding coping approaches.}

While previous research has emphasized emotional factors such as stress and anxiety, this study highlights the significance of immersive user experiences. Cognitive absorption is conceptualized as a second-order construct comprising focused immersion, temporal dissociation, heightened enjoyment, and curiosity. Data were collected from 479 daily TikTok users and analyzed using component-based structural equation modeling. Results show that cognitive absorption is the strongest predictor of problematic use, followed by nomophobia and life stress. Additionally, life stress significantly predicts nomophobia. These findings suggest that optimal user experiences - not just emotional distress - can contribute to problematic app engagement. The study offers new insights into the dual nature of cognitive absorption and emphasizes the need for digital well-being strategies, particularly for younger users.}

Despite its substantial growth potential, there is a dearth of research on user interaction with live-streaming commerce in the context of user experience (UX). To comprehend user engagement with this technology and explore avenues for UX enhancement, we devised a three-stage user study. First, we conducted a UX assessment of leading live commerce platforms, employing both a self-report questionnaire and eye tracking. This enabled us to ascertain users' perceptions of user interface (UI) and live-streaming commerce components as well as identify the most user-friendly UI design. Second, we examined frequent users' experiences via online focus group interviews (FGIs). Through these, we observed that users employ chat and reaction features to convey empathy, enjoy themselves, or obtain rewards, ultimately driving sustained engagement and interaction with live-streaming commerce. Finally, we evaluated the visual effects designed to boost interactivity and pleasurable experiences through the development of a live-streaming commerce prototype. We determined that visual effects encompassing serendipitous elements augment users’ enjoyable experiences considerably during live-streaming commerce. Our findings provide valuable insights for practitioners aiming to refine live-streaming commerce interfaces and components to enhance UX.}

Drawing from narrative persuasion theory and visual storytelling literature, the current study proposes an integrated framework to examine the storyteller, visual frame, and digital presentation characteristics of TikTok videos in predicting social-mediated public engagement and emotional reactions surrounding a recent natural disaster, the 2023 Maui Wildfire. Using visual content analysis and computational methods, the study analyzed 526 TikTok videos and 59,950 associated comments. Results showed that audiovisual vividness consistently predicted all three types of disaster engagement.

However, there has been relatively little empirical investigation of either their motivation or the outcomes of their content-sharing practices, especially in Asian contexts. Understanding Asian edu-influencers’ experiences can therefore be expected to yield fresh perspectives on a range of topics. Accordingly, drawing on uses and gratifications theory, this study recruited 12 edu-influencers specialized in teaching Chinese as a foreign language who had an average of 4835 followers on Xiaohongshu (小红书, “RedNote”), one of China’s largest social-media platforms. Through content analysis of their posts and thematic analysis of semi-structured interview data, this study explores the content they shared and the gratifications they sought and obtained. The results indicated that these Chinese edu-influencers primarily shared teaching-support, career-related support, and personal content. The chief gratifications they sought were filling in information gaps, self-documentation/self-expression, and attaining social recognition or a sense of fulfillment. They also reported that the experience of sharing enhanced their self-efficacy, professional growth, resources, skills, and emotional support, while also shaping their professional and personal goals. Additionally, we identified edu-influencers’ challenges, notably involving algorithms, censorship, and monetization. As well as yielding new understandings of the use of social media in education in an Asian context, these findings have important practical implications for teachers, teacher educators, and policymakers.}

abstract = {Background
The August 2023 wildfire in the town of Lāhainā on the island of Maui in Hawaiʻi caused catastrophic damage, affecting thousands of residents, and killing 102 people. Social media platforms, particularly TikTok, have become essential tools for crisis communication during disasters, providing real-time crisis updates, mobilizing relief efforts, and addressing misinformation. Understanding how disaster-related content is disseminated and engaged with on these platforms can inform strategies for improving emergency communication and community resilience.
Objective
Guided by Social-Mediated Crisis Communication theory, this study examined TikTok posts related to the Maui wildfires to assess content themes, public engagement, and the effectiveness of social media in disseminating disaster-related information.
Methods
TikTok posts related to the Maui wildfires were collected from August 8, 2023, to August 9, 2024. Using TikTok’s search functionality, we identified and reviewed public posts that contained relevant hashtags. Posts were categorized into 3 periods: during the disaster (August 8 to August 31, 2023), the immediate aftermath (September 1 to December 31, 2023), and the long-term recovery (January 1 to August 9, 2024). Two researchers independently coded the posts into thematic categories, achieving an interrater reliability of 87%. Engagement metrics (likes and shares) were analyzed to assess public interaction with different themes. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the associations between log-transformed likes and shares and independent variables, including time intervals, video length, the inclusion of music or effects, content themes, and hashtags.
Results
A total of 275 TikTok posts were included in the analysis. Most posts (132/275, 48%) occurred in the immediate aftermath, while 76 (27.6%) were posted during the long-term recovery phase, and 24.4% (n=67) were posted during the event. Posts during the event garnered the highest average number of likes (mean 75,092, SD 252,759) and shares (mean 10,928, SD 55,308). Posts focused on “Impact & Damage” accounted for the highest engagement, representing 36.8% (4,090,574/11,104,031) of total likes and 61.2% (724,848/1,184,049) of total shares. “Tourism Impact” (2,172,991/11,104,031, 19.6% of likes; 81,372/1,184,049, 6.9% of shares) and “Relief Efforts” (509,855/11,104,031, 4.6% of likes; 52,587/1,184,049, 4.4% of shares) were also prominent themes. Regression analyses revealed that videos with “Misinformation & Fake News” themes had the highest engagement per post, with a 4.55 coefficient for log-shares (95% CI 2.44-6.65), while videos about “Tourism Impact” and “Relief Efforts” also showed strong engagement (coefficients for log-likes: 2.55 and 1.76, respectively).
Conclusions
TikTok is an influential tool for disaster communication, amplifying both critical disaster updates and misinformation, highlighting the need for strategic content moderation and evidence-based messaging to enhance the platform’s role in crisis response. Public health officials, emergency responders, and policy makers can leverage TikTok’s engagement patterns to optimize communication strategies, improve real-time risk messaging, and support long-term community resilience.}

Specifically, the live-streaming platform can not only exclusively promote products for brands on its own platform but also nonexclusively promote products for brands from traditional retail platforms (traditional platforms). In this paper, we distinguish the influence of consumer behavioral characteristics on demand between live-streaming and traditional platforms. By developing two game models, we investigate whether the live-streaming platform should promote products for brands nonexclusively. Counterintuitively, when the live-streaming platform adopts exclusive promotion, a higher live-streaming platform's commission rate may be beneficial to the brand on it. Equally surprisingly, with nonexclusive promotion strategy, the traditional platform benefits more with the live-streaming platform's promotional ability under certain conditions. If the promotion cost coefficient is sufficiently high, the live-streaming platform should choose the exclusive promotion strategy; otherwise, it may adopt the nonexclusive promotion strategy. We further obtain the conditions for live-streaming platforms and brands from traditional platforms to cooperate. That is, given the impacts of the promotion cost coefficient and live-streaming platform's commission rate, the solo win-win situation is the exclusive promotion strategy, while given the impacts of the promotion cost coefficient and promotion fee, a win-win situation occurs under both the exclusive and nonexclusive promotion strategies.}

The results show that real-time comments exhibit a nonlinear inverted U-shaped relationship with product sales and increment in followers. Such relationship indicates that the “overloaded comments” during live streams could cause a problem on live streaming commerce platforms. In addition, we find that streamer's dialogue has a positive effect on product sales and can mitigate the inverted U-shaped relationship between real-time comments and product sales. Furthermore, we identify that streamer's dialogue has a delayed effect on product sales, with sales typically occurring 2.5 to 5 min after the dialogue ends. The findings provide valuable guidance for optimizing the management of live streaming commerce platforms.}

A total of 340 survey questionnaires are collected and data is analyzed using PLS-SEM. The findings demonstrate that presence has the strongest influence, compared to perceived enjoyment and immersion on parasocial relationship. Moreover, parasocial relationship help cultivate consumers’ trust, with stronger effect of trust in the seller than trust in the product, leading to greater purchase intention. In the technology and virtual environment, our findings shed light on the importance of viewers’ perceptual stimuli to develop parasocial relationship, shaping trust and purchase intention.

Using Hyland's interactional metadiscourse model, we analyzed a corpus of 60 LSC videos sourced from Alibaba's Taobao Live platform to identify patterns and functions of metadiscourse in fostering parasocial interaction. The findings reveal that streamers' promotional speech was rich in interactional metadiscourse. Among stance resources, self-mentions and boosters were used frequently, whereas hedges and attitude markers were less common. Engagement markers mainly included audience references, followed by questions and directives, with minimal use of personal asides and shared knowledge. These metadiscourse resources contribute to parasocial interaction. Stance resources enhance source credibility by presenting streamers as expert and trustworthy product endorsers. Engagement resources foster mutual awareness by cultivating a sense of co-presence between streamers and reviewers in personalized interactions, while also enhancing homophily by highlighting perceived similarities between the two. Collectively, these interactional metadiscourse strategies create an interactive online shopping discourse, fostering a heightened level of parasocial interaction, in which viewers are drawn into in an illusionary, reciprocal communication and form imagined friendships with streamers in the digital space.}

abstract = {Based on the flow theory, this study examines how influencer characteristics and live streaming features (interactivity, utility, entertainment, and harmony) affect the viewer's flow experience (i.e., immersion) and engagement behavior (e.g., purchasing, gifting) across different live streaming genres (utilitarian vs. hedonic, high vs. low involvement; a 2 × 2 between-subjects design). As extensions of the literature, it focuses on live streaming features (rather than merely the influencer), the mediating effect of flow experience, and differences across live streaming genres. Analysis of data from 1233 Chinese live streaming users shows that interactivity, utility, and entertainment (but not harmony) stimulate the viewer's flow experience, which mediates their effects on monetary and non-monetary engagement behaviors. Contrary to intuition, since flow experiences require a balance of utility and entertainment, influencers need to emphasize utility in hedonic live streaming genres and entertainment in utilitarian genres. Utility is more important and interactivity is less important in high-involvement and hedonic genres. Regarding influencer characteristics, trustworthiness, expertise, and charisma positively influence the flow experience. As a contribution to the live streaming literature, this study explains how live streaming features can be optimized to improve customer engagement.}

abstract = {This research examined teachers' posts about ChatGPT on TikTok during the first year of ChatGPT's public availability. A data set of 256 posts were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively to describe the ideas of these early adopters, how these ideas resonated with viewers, and what these posts revealed about the teachers' practices and attitudes regarding ChatGPT. Our analysis found that these early adopters focused on practical advice on lesson planning and productivity to relieve the stresses of teaching. However, themes relating to tensions beyond the classroom and the changing nature of teaching and learning resonated the most with viewers.}
