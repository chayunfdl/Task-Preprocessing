abstract = {Purpose
To assess the validity and informational value of the material about the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) provided on TikTok.
Methods
The terms “posterior cruciate ligament” and “PCL” were used as keywords for an extensive search of the video content on the TikTok video platform. The video duration and the numbers of likes, shares, saves, and views were recorded for each video. The quality and reliability assessments of the video content were conducted via the DISCERN instrument, Journal of the American Medical Association benchmark criteria, and Global Quality Score.
Results
A total of 48 videos were included in the analysis, of which 18 (37.5%) were posted by physiotherapists; 14 (29.2%), by private users; and 16 (33.3%), by medical doctors/doctors of osteopathic medicine. Most of the information concerned clinical examination (12-25%) or patient experience (12-25%). Video content was focused on education in 26 videos (54.2%), patient experience in 11 (22.9%), and rehabilitation in 11 (22.9%). Most of the videos used music as the background audio (29-60.4%). The mean length of the videos was 29.29 ± 26.95 seconds. The mean number of views was 565,863.02 ± 2,686,462.45, whereas the mean numbers of likes, comments, shares, and saves were 15,533.58 ± 73,143.51, 127.85 ± 671.49, 661.38 ± 3,049.96, and 1,473.90 ± 7,523.37, respectively. The mean DISCERN score, Journal of the American Medical Association score, and Global Quality Score were 16.15 ± 2.53, 0.15 ± 0.36, and 1.08 ± 0.28, respectively, indicating the poorest quality for all 3 indices.
Conclusions
Videos about the PCL on the TikTok platform are not comprehensive and have low educational value.
Clinical Relevance
Given the growing number of patients using social media to seek information about their medical concerns, it is crucial for orthopaedic health care practitioners to recognize the constraints of TikTok videos that focus on the PCL as possible sources of information for their patients.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Background
Resistance exercise is considered first-line management for lateral elbow tendinopathy (LET). TikTok enables sharing of short-form videos with algorithms distributing videos with higher engagement (e.g., views/likes).
Purpose
To assess resistance exercise video quality for LET on TikTok between general users and self-identified health care professionals and explore associations between engagement and video quality.
Study Design
Social media review using a systematic review framework.
Methods
TikTok was searched using five hashtags. Included videos were in English and focused on resisted exercise. Creator and video engagement metrics were extracted, with viewing index and engagement rate calculated. The DISCERN and Tennis Elbow Exercise Education Score (TEEES) were used to assess video quality. A Kruskal-Wallis test examined differences between general users and self-identified health care professionals and Spearman’s rho (rs) correlations explored associations between video quality and engagement metrics. Median (interquartile range) were reported.
Results
Ninety-eight videos were included with no significant differences in engagement between general users and self-identified health care professionals. Overall, resistance exercise video quality was poor with no significant differences between general users (DISCERN 26 [22-29] out of 75, TEEES 8 [5-10] out of 25) and self-identified health care professionals (DISCERN 25 [21-27], TEEES 7 [5-9]; p = 0.37 and p = 0.35, respectively). Video quality was weakly correlated with video likes, favourites, and viewing index (rs = 0.23, p = 0.03; rs = 0.23, p = 0.02; rs = 0.21, p = 0.04, respectively).
Conclusions
The quality of resistance-based exercise videos for LET on TikTok was poor, regardless of user profile. While some engagement metrics were associated with video quality, viewers should not rely on these metrics to indicate video quality.}

abstract = {Objectives
Short video addiction has emerged as a significant public health issue in recent years, with a growing trend toward severity. However, research on the causes and impacts of short video addiction remains limited, and understanding of the variable “TikTok brain” is still in its infancy. Therefore, based on the Stimulus-Organism-Behavior-Consequence (SOBC) framework, we proposed six research hypotheses and constructed a model to explore the relationships between short video usage intensity, TikTok brain, short video addiction, and decreased attention control.
Methods
Given that students are considered a high-risk group for excessive short video use, we collected 1086 valid participants from Chinese student users, including 609 males (56.1%) and 477 females (43.9%), with an average participant age of 19.84 years, to test the hypotheses.
Results
(1) Short video usage intensity was positively related to short video addiction, TikTok brain, and decreased attention control; (2) TikTok brain was positively related to short video addiction and decreased attention control; and (3) Short video addiction was positively related to decreased attention control.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that although excessive use of short video applications brings negative consequences, users still spend significant amounts of time on these platforms, indicating a need for strict self-regulation of usage time.}

The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of viewing WIEIAD TikTok videos (with and without calories) on body-related shame, guilt and envy, and intentions to change diet in young women. We also examined indirect effects of upward appearance comparisons and moderating effects of self-compassion. Participants were young women [N = 335, Mage =25 years (SD = 3.24)] recruited for a study titled “social media use, self-perceptions and mood” (cover story) through Cloud Research Connect. Participants were randomly assigned to view a series of a) WIEIAD videos with calories, b) WIEIAD videos without calories or c) travel videos (control). Participants who viewed WIEIAD videos (with or without calories) reported higher body-related envy and intentions to diet than participants who viewed travel videos. No differences were reported between participants who viewed WIEIAD videos with or without calories. Appearance comparisons mediated the relationship between WIEIAD videos and body-related shame, guilt, envy, and intentions to change diet, however self-compassion did not moderate any relationships. Researchers should investigate ways to mitigate upward social comparisons elicited by viewing WIEIAD content.}

This study explores the moderated mediation effect of TikTok influence on sustainable purchase intentions, emphasizing the roles of sustainable attitudes and environmental consciousness. Grounded in social cognitive theory and environmental psychology, data were collected through a cross-sectional approach from active TikTok users. Using SmartPLS (v3.0) for measurement and structural model evaluation, the findings reveal that TikTok influence positively affects sustainable purchase intentions through the mediation of sustainable attitudes. Furthermore, environmental consciousness strengthens this mediating effect, indicating that individuals with higher levels of environmental awareness and concern are more likely to translate their exposure to TikTok content into sustainable purchasing behaviors. This research highlights the critical role of social media platforms in shaping consumer attitudes and behaviors towards sustainability and offers essential theoretical insights and practical implications for marketers and policymakers aiming to promote sustainable consumption through digital channels.}

In recent years, integrating text and image data for sentiment analysis in social networks has become a key approach. However, techniques for capturing complex cross-modal information and effectively fusing multimodal features still have shortcomings. We design a multimodal sentiment analysis model called the Dynamic Graph-Text Fusion Network (DGFN) to address these challenges. Text features are captured by leveraging the neighborhood information aggregation properties of Graph Convolutional Networks, treating words as nodes and integrating their features through their adjacency relationships. Additionally, the multi-head attention mechanism is utilized to extract rich semantic information from different subspaces simultaneously. For image feature extraction, a convolutional attention module is employed. Subsequently, an attention-based fusion module integrates the text and image features. Experimental results on the two datasets show significant improvements in sentiment classification accuracy and F1 scores, validating the effectiveness of the proposed DGFN model.}

abstract = {Background
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, asexual (LGBTQIA+) researchers and participants frequently encounter hostility in virtual environments, particularly on social media platforms where public commentary on research advertisements can foster stigmatization. Despite a growing body of work on researcher virtual hostility, little empirical research has examined the actual content and emotional tone of public responses to LGBTQIA+-focused research recruitment.
Objective
This study aimed to analyze the thematic patterns and sentiment of social media comments directed at LGBTQIA+ research recruitment advertisements, in order to better understand how virtual stigma is communicated and how it may impact both researchers and potential participants.
Methods
A total of 994 publicly visible Facebook comments posted in response to LGBTQIA+ recruitment advertisements (January to April 2024) were collected and analyzed. Text preprocessing included tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization. Latent Dirichlet allocation was used to identify latent themes across the dataset. Sentiment analysis was conducted using the Bing Liu and National Research Council lexicons, with scores ranging from –1 (most negative) to 1 (most positive). Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count was used to quantify psychological and moral language features. Comments were also manually coded into four audience target groups (researchers, LGBTQIA+ community, general public, and other commenters), and language category differences were analyzed using 1-way ANOVAs with Bonferroni corrections.
Results
Topic modeling identified three key themes: (1) “Transitions, Health, and Gender Dysphoria,” (2) “Polarized Debate and Response,” and (3) “Religious and Ideological Debates.” Topic 2 had the highest average prevalence (average γ=0.486, SD 0.21). Sentiment analysis revealed negative mean sentiment scores for all three topics: Topic 1 (–0.41, SD 0.48), Topic 2 (–0.21, SD 0.44), and Topic 3 (–0.35, SD 0.46). No topic exhibited a statistically significant predominance of positive sentiment. A 1-way ANOVA showed significant differences in linguistic tone across target groups: negative tone (F3,990=12.84; P<.001), swearing (F3,990=16.07; P<.001), and anger-related language (F3,990=9.45; P<.001), with the highest levels found in comments directed at researchers. Comments targeting LGBTQIA+ individuals showed higher references to mental illness, morality, and threats to children. While affirming responses were less frequent and typically appeared within confrontational contexts, their presence highlights significant moments of solidarity and resistance.
Conclusions
This study documents a persistently hostile virtual environment for LGBTQIA+ research, where researchers are frequently dehumanized and LGBTQIA+ identities are pathologized. These findings reinforce stigma communication models and suggest a need for institutional responses that include mental health support, enhanced moderation tools, and policy advocacy. Future research should investigate how hostile discourse affects researchers’ well-being and recruitment outcomes, and evaluate interventions to foster more respectful engagement with LGBTQIA+ studies.}

Using Named Entity Recognition, emotion analysis, topic clustering, and opinion mining, the study reveals key themes, entities, and emotional responses among Chinese netizens. The analysis shows that Chinese netizens express views on humanitarian concerns, calls for peace, support for Palestinian national liberation, and demands for accurate information. Emotion-opinion cross-analysis reveals that their responses are shaped by a mix of emotions, including anger towards external geopolitical forces, fear and sadness regarding humanitarian impacts, and hope for peace and resolution. These emotions illustrate the complex interplay between humanitarian concerns, political stances, and support for diplomacy, demonstrating Weibo’s role as a platform for amplifying public sentiment. The study also examines how Chinese public opinion aligns with the Chinese government’s stance on international affairs. Findings indicate broad support for the government’s diplomatic efforts, such as calls for ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and mediation. This alignment reflects an expectation for China to actively contribute to global peace and stability. Additionally, the study uncovers critical perspectives on external influences, with many netizens criticizing perceived biases in international responses and advocating for a balanced, multilateral diplomatic approach. Overall, this research highlights how a distant geopolitical crisis is understood in China’s socio-political context, revealing an emerging global consciousness among Chinese netizens. This shift, facilitated by Weibo, reflects a movement from a state-centric narrative to an active public engagement with global issues.}

Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Mann-Whitney U test to evaluate differences in engagement metrics based on the presence or absence of the themes. Videos addressing Employment Opportunities (76 %), Economic Mobility (68 %), and Education Quality (65 %) received the highest engagement. The comment analysis showed significant associations between themes such as Income Potential, Employment Opportunities, Economic Mobility, Social Capital, Debt and Financial Stress with higher video likes. However, health related themes, despite being integral to the SDH framework, were either absent or insignificant in comment discussions. These findings underscore the public's emphasis on financial and career-related concerns over broader health implications. Future research should explore the extent to which SDH-related benefits—such as health resources, access, and literacy—influence decisions about pursuing higher education.}

Results demonstrate that, as a search engine, TikTok is perceived as less valuable than traditional search engines (e.g., Google) in terms of convenience, reassurance, independence, privacy, and functionality. Meanwhile, evaluative actions primarily focus on checking others’ comments and video elements rather than checking other official outside sources. Live-streaming and algorithm-driven recommendations significantly impact users’ perceived credibility of information found on TikTok and their sense of social presence. Algorithm-based recommendations also play a crucial role in shaping users’ trust in content and their verification behaviors. Contrary to expectations, meta-voicing (i.e., users’ engagement via the comment section and reactions) does not predict social presence, which hints at the need to refine existing affordance frameworks for short-form video platforms. Social presence and perceived source credibility, in turn, significantly predict information-seeking behaviors. Interestingly, higher perceived credibility leads to more evaluative actions being taken to reassess information found on TikTok. Empirically, the findings have implications for information literacy initiatives, platform design, and algorithmic transparency to understand users’ searching behaviors and how they evaluate information credibility on social media platforms. Theoretical implications of the findings, as well as limitations and suggestions for future research, are further discussed.}

The utilization of social media for health-related purposes has surged, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. TikTok, a short-form video platform, has seen substantial growth, becoming a prominent medium for health information dissemination. However, the lack of regulation poses challenges in evaluating the validity of TikTok content.
Methods
This cross-sectional study assesses TikTok videos related to total knee arthroplasty rehabilitation exercises. Search terms identified 84 videos, with 64 meeting the inclusion criteria. Engagement metrics and quality scores were analyzed, utilizing the DISCERN tool and the Total Knee Replacement Exercises Education Score.
Results
The analyzed videos accumulated nearly 6 million views, with a median of 10,293.5 (interquartile range = 4139.3-26,100.0). Health-care professionals contributed 48% of the content. Despite higher engagement metrics for health-care professional videos, the overall quality, as indicated by DISCERN and Total Knee Replacement Exercises Education scores, remained poor. No videos achieved an “excellent” rating, with the majority categorized as “poor.”
Conclusions
This study underscores TikTok’s substantial role in total knee arthroplasty rehabilitation information dissemination but reveals a critical deficit in content quality and reliability. Health-care professionals marginally outperformed general users but displayed overall inadequacy. The study emphasizes the necessity for improving the quality of health-related content on emerging social media platforms, especially within the realm of orthopaedic surgery.

Social media platforms, such as TikTok, may be powerful vectors for transmission of both harmful and helpful self-harm and suicide-related content; however, this has not been rigorously studied.
Objective
This study aims to identify and understand the themes and overall characteristics of videos related to self-harm and suicide on TikTok.
Methods
Snowball sampling was used to identify the 10 most-viewed TikTok hashtags related to self-harm and suicide, which were then used to select the most-viewed English-language posts up to June 2023. An inductive coding reliability approach to thematic analysis was iteratively applied by 2 independent coders to identify and analyze common themes within the videos.
Results
In total, 188 videos were included in the thematic analysis. Five main themes and 2 subthemes were identified: emotional distress, hope and recovery-based messaging, grief and memorialization of those who died by suicide, social functions associated with self-harm and suicide-related content (subthemes: gallows humor and sarcasm; glamorization of self-harm and suicide-related behavior), and shame and guilt associated with self-harm and suicide-related behavior.
Conclusions
Self-harm and suicide-related content on TikTok was diverse, encompassing both potentially harmful (eg, normalization of self-harm behavior) and helpful (eg, recovery-focused messaging) characteristics. Therefore, a multifaceted and collaborative approach is needed to address the risks of potentially harmful content while leveraging the positive characteristics to promote the safety and well-being of TikTok users.}

A 1-way analysis of variance was applied to assess differences in engagement between evidence-based, non-evidence-based, or misinformation videos. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed to analyze differences in engagement based on video accuracy.
Results
Of the 224 videos analyzed, 65% were classified as evidence-based, while 32% were non-evidence-based. Misinformation outperformed the other categories in shares, saves, and views. No significant differences in engagement metrics were found between evidence-based and non-evidence-based videos.
Conclusions and Implications
These findings offer insights into how breastfeeding information is portrayed on TikTok and may inform strategies to improve the dissemination of accurate, evidence-based content on social media platforms.}

abstract = {Background
TikTok’s MedTok is an interconnected network of patients, providers, and producers sharing knowledge and experiences of health-related topics. Awareness of popular content on weight loss medications can benefit health care professionals, especially regarding adverse effects and management.
Objectives
Describe content in popular TikTok videos using adverse effect hashtags for gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. Compare content between health care and non-health care creators and reported adverse effects versus medication package inserts.
Methods
This observational study evaluated videos for popular GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist side-effect hashtags on TikTok, in June 2023. Video metadata collected included content creator demographics and content of video, including adverse effects discussed and recommendations to address these. Adverse effects were compared to package insert data. Qualitative data was evaluated through descriptive coding, quantitative data through descriptive statistics, and Pearson chi-square for comparisons.
Results
A total of 165 videos were analyzed. Content creators were mostly medication users (89%) and non-health care professionals (90%). Medication indications included weight loss (82%), polycystic ovarian syndrome (20%), and diabetes (6%). Diet, exercise, or weight loss were discussed in 34%, 16%, and 38% of videos, respectively. Non-health care professionals mentioned specific products to address adverse effects more frequently than health care professionals, 24% versus 13% (P = 0.292). All adverse effects mentioned in at least 5 videos aligned with medication package inserts, most commonly gastrointestinal disturbances, except for insomnia.
Conclusion
Most content creators were non-health care professionals and medication users. Despite Ozempic and Mounjaro lacking Food and Drug Administration approval for weight loss at the time, it was the most identified indication. The alignment of most reported adverse effects with medication package inserts underscores the reliability of user-shared experiences, though discrepancies like insomnia were noted. Given TikTok's remarkable reach and influence, awareness of patient-reported experiences and recommendations is essential for health care providers to enhance care and dispel misconceptions.}

abstract = {Background
The rise of short-video platforms, such as TikTok (Douyin in China) and Bilibili, has significantly influenced how health information is disseminated to the public. However, the quality, reliability, and effectiveness of health-related content on these platforms, particularly regarding uterine fibroids, remain underexplored. Uterine fibroids are a common medical condition that affects a substantial proportion of women worldwide. While these platforms have become vital sources of health education, misinformation and incomplete content may undermine their efficacy.
Objective
This study aims to address these gaps by evaluating the quality and dissemination effectiveness of uterine fibroid–related health information on TikTok and Bilibili.
Methods
A total of 200 uterine fibroid-related videos (100 from TikTok and 100 from Bilibili) were selected through a keyword search. The videos were evaluated by 2 trained gynecological experts using the Global Quality Score (GQS) and a modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) tool. In addition, the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audio and Visual Materials was used to assess the understandability and actionability of the videos. Statistical analyses, including the Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman rank correlation, and stepwise regression analysis, were used to assess differences between platforms and identify predictors of video quality.
Results
The results indicated that TikTok outperformed Bilibili in terms of user engagement metrics, such as likes, comments, shares, and followers (all P<.001). However, Bilibili videos were generally longer than those on TikTok (P<.001). The videos on both platforms demonstrated suboptimal overall quality and reliability, reflected by median GQS score of 3 (IQR 3-4) for TikTok and the median GQS score of Bilibili is 3 (IQR 2-4). The median modified DISCERN scores were also low: 2 (IQR 2‐2) for TikTok and 2 (IQR 2‐2) for Bilibili, with no significant differences between the 2 platforms (P=.62 for GQS; P=.18 for mDISCERN). The videos on both platforms yielded comparable median scores for Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool-Understandability (PEMAT-U) and Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool-Actionability (PEMAT-A). The median score of PEMAT-U was 77% (IQR 69%-83%) for TikTok and 77% (IQR 69%-85%) for Bilibili. The PEMAT-A yielded a median score of 67% (IQR 33%-67%) for TikTok and 67% (IQR 0-67%) for Bilibili. Videos uploaded by medical professionals on TikTok had significantly higher quality scores compared to those uploaded by nonprofessionals. A moderate positive correlation was observed between the GQS and mDISCERN scores (r=0.41, P<.01), indicating an interrelationship between quality and reliability. Stepwise regression analysis identified “completeness score,” “source,” and “PEMAT scores” as significant predictors of video quality.
Conclusions
This study highlights the generally low quality of uterine fibroid–related health information on short-video platforms, although TikTok showed better performance in terms of engagement and quality. The involvement of medical professionals was found to enhance video quality. These findings underscore the need for improved oversight of health content on social media platforms and greater involvement of health care professionals to ensure the dissemination of accurate and reliable health information.}

author = {Riccardo D’Ambrosi and Thais Dutra Vieira and Bertrand Sonnery-Cottet},
abstract = {Purpose
To assess the validity and informational value of TikTok content related to the anterolateral ligament (ALL) of the knee.
Methods
The terms “anterolateral ligament of the knee,” “ALL reconstruction,” “LET,” “lateral extra-articular tenodesis,” “Lemaire,” and “Segond fracture” were used as keywords for an extensive search of video content on the TikTok video platform in August 2024. The video duration and the numbers of likes, shares, saves, and views were recorded for each video. The quality and reliability assessments of the video content were conducted via the DISCERN instrument, Journal of the American Medical Association benchmark criteria, and Global Quality Score.
Results
A total of 55 videos were included in the analysis, of which 4 (7.3%) were posted by physiotherapists; 7 (12.7%), doctors of osteopathic medicine; 38 (69.1%), patients; and 6 (10.9%), medical doctors. Most of the information concerned patient experience (36%-65.5%). The mean length of the videos was 39.56 ± 49.31 seconds. The mean number of views was 16,444.44 ± 49,509.91, whereas the mean number of likes was 739.05 ± 2,558.24; comments, 9.40 ± 20.06; shares, 10.47 ± 33.59; and saves, 44.02 ± 113.35. The mean DISCERN score, Journal of the American Medical Association score, and Global Quality Score were 15.45 ± 1.56, 0.04 ± 0.19, and 1.07 ± 0.26, respectively, indicating the poorest quality for all 3 indices.
Conclusions
Most of the videos on TikTok about the ALL of the knee are posted by patients. Videos created by health professionals are significantly more valid and reliable than those created by patients, but all the videos have low educational value.
Clinical Relevance
In light of the increasing number of patients who use social media for medical information, it is imperative for orthopaedic health care professionals to acknowledge the limitations of TikTok videos concerning the ALL as potential informational resources for their patients.}

The result revealed that most reviews were classified as positive, meaning that the data were imbalanced and challenging to handle in further analysis. Therefore, Random Under-sampling (RUS) and Random Over-sampling (ROS) methods were deployed to deal with that condition. The labeled reviews were subsequently pre-processed using tools such as case folding, noise removal, normalization, and stopwords before being used for training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for sentiment classification. The SVM trained without resampling produced the most favorable results, with an F1-score of 0.80.}

The results indicate that acknowledgement from the streamer is a significant positive predictor of viewers' willingness to gift (WTG). Further analysis reveals that the variable ‘gifting elasticity’ is also a significant predictor of WTG, implying that viewers who have pre-purchased coins are more likely to gift. These findings enhance our understanding of the motivations behind gifting in social media livestreams and highlight effective strategies that streamers can use to increase gifting.

abstract = {Background
Mpox has reemerged as a global public health concern. With the growing reliance on social media for health information dissemination, understanding public perception through these platforms is essential for designing effective health promotion strategies.
Objective
This study analyzes TikTok data related to mpox using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. This paper aims to extract key topics and inform targeted health promotion strategies for mpox prevention and control.
Methods
Using the “Aisou Jisou” system, we collected TikTok data containing the keyword “Mpox” from April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2025. The dataset comprised 25,672 text data and associated search terms. We analyzed trends in the Search Index and Target Group Index (TGI) across time, gender, age groups, and provinces. LDA topic modeling was applied to identify latent topics within the text data, and topic evolution was examined during 4 peak months of the Search Index.
Results
A total of 4 major Search Index peaks were identified on TikTok in China, which are May 2022, July 2023, August 2024, and February 2025. These peaks aligned with key global and national mpox events, including WHO’s declaration of a global mpox outbreak in May 2022 and the detection of the clade Ib Mpox in China in January 2025. TGI analysis revealed that users aged 18‐23 years exhibited the highest engagement. Spatially, Beijing, Tianjin, and Jilin recorded the highest cumulative TGI values (5922.38, 5692.41, and 3579.90, respectively). LDA topic modeling identified 8 primary topics, including transmission and prevention, vaccine concerns, and misinformation, etc. Public attention evolved from general disease knowledge toward issues of stigmatization and vaccine distrust over time. Sankey diagrams illustrated shifts in public attention across topics at different Search Index peaks, with “Mpox Transmission and Prevention” receiving the most attention in May 2022 and “Mpox Vaccination and Infection Prevention” in February 2025.
Conclusions
TikTok provides real-time insights into public attention during mpox outbreaks, but can also propagate misinformation and stigmatizing narratives. Public health authorities should leverage these platforms for timely communication, actively address misinformation, and mitigate social bias. Tailored strategies are needed to enhance health literacy, minimize stigma, and strengthen outbreak preparedness and response. This study highlights the dual role of social media as both an information source and a potential vector for misinformation, emphasizing the necessity for active monitoring and regulation by health authorities to ensure the accuracy and reliability of disseminated health information.}

Methods
TikTok videos tagged #measles were sampled by selecting the first 100 results. Using a structured codebook, videos were classified by source, tone, vaccination stance, content focus, target audience, and Vitamin A mention. Engagement metrics were analyzed using t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for binary predictors and two-way ANOVA for source–tone interactions. Analyses were conducted in Excel and RStudio.
Results
The 100 TikTok videos tagged with #measles in this sample garnered over 30 million views, with experts producing 44% of them. Expert-created videos received significantly more views, likes, favorites, and comments than non-expert ones, and tone was linked to differences in saves, with an expertise–tone interaction affecting comments. Most coded content features, such as conspiracy theories, policy mentions, side effects, or Vitamin A, appeared in fewer than 5% of videos and showed no significant relationship to engagement. Two-way ANOVAs confirmed that comments were the only metric significantly influenced by the interplay between expertise and tone, with no other meaningful interactions observed.
Conclusions
These results highlight the importance of credible messengers and carefully chosen tone to maximize audience engagement with measles-related content on TikTok. Future research is needed to determine whether such engagement translates into changes in vaccine attitudes or behaviors.}

Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a widely used treatment for advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, often requiring multiple sessions for optimal efficacy. TikTok and Bilibili have gained widespread popularity as easily accessible sources of health information.
Objective
This study aims to assess the quality of the information in Chinese short videos on TACE shared on TikTok and Bilibili.
Methods
In November 2024, the top 100 TACE-related Chinese-language short videos on TikTok and Bilibili (a total of 200 videos) were assessed and reviewed. Initially, basic information about the videos was recorded and analyzed. Subsequently, Global Quality Score and the DISCERN tool were used to evaluate the information quality and reliability of the videos on both platforms. Finally, multifactorial analysis was used to identify potential factors influencing the quality of the videos.
Results
TikTok is more popular than Bilibili, despite its videos being shorter in length (P<.001). The quality of short videos on TACE found on both platforms was of low quality, with average Global Quality Score scores of 2.31 (SD 0.81) on TikTok and 2.48 (SD 0.80) on Bilibili, as well as DISCERN scores of 1.86 (SD 0.40) on TikTok and 2.00 (SD 0.44) on Bilibili. The number of saves (β=.184, P=.008; β=.176, P=.01) and days (β=.214, P=.002; β=.168, P=.01) since publication were identified as closely related variables to video quality and reliability. Furthermore, the duration of the video was closely related to its reliability (β=.213, P=.002).
Conclusions
This study indicates that the quality of TACE-related health information in the top 100 short videos on both Bilibili and TikTok platforms is suboptimal. Patients should exercise caution when relying on health-related information from these platforms. Social media companies should establish review teams with basic medical knowledge. It is essential for the platforms to enhance their recommendation algorithms and implement measures for video quality assessment. Health care professionals should be aware of the limitations of these videos and work to improve their quality.}

Utilizing data from 438 participants and employing PLS-SEM and fsQCA, the results reveal that vividness, telepresence, and playfulness positively affect credibility, trust, and familiarity, which drive repeat purchase intention. Additionally, credibility, trust, and familiarity also act as mediating variables to promote repeat purchase intention. The fsQCA results identify multiple sufficient configurations leading to high repeat purchase intention.

abstract = {﻿Abstract
Wild meat trade poses significant threats to biodiversity and human health. Despite these threats, trade and consumption are increasing, driven largely by growing demand in urban centers. Easy access to the internet and social media platforms further facilitates wildlife trade and consumption by connecting traders and consumers. This study examines 80 TikTok videos from public (open) accounts of two wild meat traders in Lomé, Togo, showcasing wild meat sales between November 2022 and April 2024. The videos featured various smoked wild animals, representing approximately 3,526 individuals across 27 inferred species, predominantly birds (40.9%) and mammals (39.6%), but also included reptiles (19.5%). Prices for whole smoked animals varied significantly (from a minimum of 3.4 USD to a maximum of 340 USD), depending on the species and the size of the individual animal. Among the 27 recorded species were the Endangered white-bellied pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis), classified as a CITES Appendix I species with a declining population trend; the Vulnerable Buffon’s kob (Kobus kob ssp. kob); the Near Threatened Defassa waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus ssp. defassa); and three CITES II-listed species. The 80 videos had each been viewed between 660 and 216,000 times, and all 80 videos had been viewed 1,795,079 times in total. This high level of visibility may fuel demand and unintentionally promote further trade by exposing a broad audience to such content. The findings highlight how social media can have significant negative conservation implications for the long-term survival and sustainable management of these species. Although enforcement mechanisms have been implemented to curb illegal wildlife trade on social media, these platforms still serve as vast, often unregulated marketplaces where traders and customers can easily connect, offering a level of convenience that traditional markets lack. We recommend that social media platforms strengthen their enforcement measures while conservationists leverage these platforms to raise awareness, promote wildlife protection laws, and mobilize public support for conservation efforts. The demand for wild meat in Lomé is driven by the growing population, cultural and economic benefits, as well as a lack of awareness. The study highlights the urgent need for targeted education, stronger enforcement of wildlife protection laws, and better communication about the legal status and conservation importance of the species.}

abstract = {Objectives
We aimed to compare the metrics, creator type, tone, and content of TikTok videos tagged with #HormonalBirthControl to those tagged with #FertilityAwarenessMethod.
Methods
We collected two convenience samples of 100 videos tagged with either #HormonalBirthControl or #FertilityAwarenessMethod on TikTok using the data-scraping program Apify (Prague, Czech Republic). We extracted number of views, likes, comments, and shares, and analyzed for tone, themes, and creator demographics. Two independent reviewers coded the videos and a third arbitrated differences.
Results
A total of 90 videos tagged with #HormonalBirthControl and 86 with #FertilityAwarenessMethod met our inclusion criteria of being publicly available, in English, and relevant to the topic. Of the #HormonalBirthControl videos, 63.3% had a negative tone compared to 24.4% of the #FertilityAwarenessMethod videos. Patients created 73.3% of the #HormonalBirthControl videos. Non-medical professionals who describe themselves as “fertility awareness educators” and “hormone health coaches” created 83.5% of #FertilityAwarenessMethod videos. #FertilityAwarenessMethod videos were shared an average of 2,280.6 times compared to 230.6 times for #HormonalBirthControl videos. Of #HormonalBirthControl videos, 67.8% mentioned birth control side effects/symptoms and 22.2% mentioned distrust of Western medicine and/or physicians. Of the #FertilityAwarenessMethod videos, 39.5% referenced a lack of reproductive education.
Conclusions
Most of the TikTok content about hormonal birth control and fertility awareness methods were not created by medical professionals. There appears to be significant interest in fertility awareness methods based on the high number of video shares. The conversations surrounding hormonal birth control are dominated by concerns about hormonal side effects. There is room for medical professionals to create educational content on these topics.}

Short videos stimulate users’ senses through audiovisual content, offering both entertainment and disseminating information. However, the underlying mechanisms influencing consumer engagement behaviors remain largely unknown. By analyzing short video advertisements from TikTok, we find four key audiovisual features—namely, colloquial expression, cadence, colorfulness, and visual prominence—that are significantly correlated with consumer engagement behaviors. For the first time, we integrate these audiovisual features with the multimodal theory and the elaboration likelihood model, enriching the research literature on consumer perception. Furthermore, we discover the moderating effect of product types and release time. Methodologically, our feature extraction methods, based on machine and deep learning contribute to social media research, offering insights into how influencers can leverage the audiovisual elements of short videos to captivate users.}

Social media platforms have significant potential to enhance public knowledge on how to respond to generalised seizures. Among the platforms, TikTok emerges as a standout performer, demonstrating exceptional user engagement.
Study objective
This study aimed to assess the quality of content on first aid for seizures posted on TikTok.
Methods
TikTok videos providing instructions on first aid for generalised seizures and having at least 100,000 views were analysed for completeness and correctness of the advice using a 21-item checklist. Any misleading recommendations suggesting inappropriate actions were collected from the videos and users’ comments on the videos.
Results
Nineteen eligible videos had a total of 19,502,200 views. The videos frequently omitted key guidelines-concordant instructions on first aid for seizures, in particular, to lay the person down to prevent falling (missed in 84.2% of the videos), avoid moving the person unless they are in danger (89.5%), check the person’s breathing once the seizure has ended (89.5%) and commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation if the person remains unresponsive and not breathing normally (94.7%). Nine videos (47.4%) contained misleading instructions, most commonly to put the person on their side or otherwise move them during the seizure. Multiple comments to the videos advocated futile and dangerous actions, for instance, putting objects into the person’s mouth, restraining, or hitting the person.
Conclusion
TikTok videos convey information on first aid for seizures to multi-million audiences concurrently propagating incomplete, inaccurate and potentially harmful non-evidence-based advice. Urgent research and regulatory efforts are needed to develop effective strategies to combat the misinformation spread.}

keywords = {misinformation, social media, TikTok, alternative health, cancer, computer vision},
abstract = {Background
Health misinformation is abundant online and becoming an increasingly pressing concern for both oncology practitioners and patients with cancer. On social media platforms, including the popular audiovisual app TikTok, the flourishing alternative health industry is further contributing to the spread of misleading and often harmful information, endangering patients’ health and outcomes and sowing distrust of the medical community. The prevalence of false and potentially dangerous treatments on a platform that is used as a quasi–search engine by young people poses a serious risk to the health of patients with cancer.
Objective
This study seeks to examine how cancer discourse on TikTok differs between alternative health and conventional medicine videos. It aims to look beyond mere facts and falsehoods that TikTok users may utter to understand the visual language and format used in the support of both misleading and truthful narratives, as well as other messages.
Methods
Using computer vision analysis and subsequent qualitative close reading of 831 TikTok videos, this study examined how alternative health and conventional medicine videos on cancer differ with regard to the visual language used. Videos were examined for the length of time and prominence in which faces are displayed, as well as for the background setting, location, and dominant color scheme.
Results
The results show that the alt-health and conventional health samples made different use of the audiovisual affordances of TikTok. First, videos from the alternative health sample were more likely to contain a single face that was prominently featured (making up at least 7.5% of the image) for a substantial period of time (35% of the shots), with these testimonial-style videos making up 28.5% (93/326) of the sample compared to 18.6% (94/505) of the conventional medicine sample. Alternative health videos predominantly featured cool tones (P<.001) and were significantly more likely to be filmed outdoors (P<.001), whereas conventional medicine videos were more likely to be shot indoors and feature warm tones such as red, orange, or yellow.
Conclusions
The findings of this study contribute to an increased understanding of misinformation as not merely a matter of individual falsehoods but also a phenomenon whose effects might be transported through emotive as well as rational means. They also point to influencer practices and style being an important contributing factor in the declining health of the information environment around cancer and its treatment. The results suggest that public health efforts must extend beyond correcting false statements by injecting factual information into the online cancer discourse and look toward incorporating both visual and rational strategies.}

We examine how TikTok duetters create the illusion of conversing together in real time by applying conversation analysis methods to a judgment sample of TikTok duets, with a focus on strategies of turn-taking and overlapping. OVs and RVs collaborate to various extents in co-constructing duet conversations; OVs by explicitly or implicitly inviting duets, and RVs by orienting to OVs through the positioning and timing of their responses. Through these interactional dynamics, duetters performatively evoke participant roles, personae, and situational contexts, while simultaneously pursuing broader communicative goals of entertaining and growing an audience of followers.}

With most Canadians on social media, we aimed to use Natural Language Processing of social data to examine public sentiment towards exotic pet trade in Canada. We analysed 9,274 posts on Twitter (now 'X') about exotic pets between 2012 and 2022, and 150,236 comments from 2568 TikTok videos showing exotic pets from 50 unique Canadian accounts. We found that social media users demonstrate markedly positive attitudes towards the live trade in reptiles and amphibians, mammals, birds, and arachnids and insects, even on TikTok videos showing poor animal care and questionable legality. We propose a conceptual framework for how exotic pet influencers directly and indirectly contribute to increased demand for exotic pets through opinion leadership, sharing information on where to buy exotic pets, and normalising exotic pet ownership. We suggest that it is important to raise public awareness among social media users about the challenges associated with wildlife trade, including animal welfare considerations, and the links between exotic pet trade and conservation.}

abstract = {Background
The social medical application, TikTok, continues to have increasing influence in the United States, now with greater than 60% of those younger than 30 using the application. Among females using the application, 58% report using TikTok as a source of news and information.(1) After the publication of the “U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use, 2024” by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in August 2024, there has been increased attention to the use of analgesia/anesthesia for the insertion of intrauterine devices (IUDs).(2) Major news sources, including The New York Times and NBC, have published articles calling attention to the inadequate pain relief provided during gynecologic procedures, particularly during IUD insertions.(3,4,5) This study aims to assess the current perception and understanding of IUD insertion pain among young adults based on TikTok content.
Methods
Using the terms “IUD insertion” on 8/8/2024, quantitative data (likes, comments, views, shares) was collected from the top 50 TikTok videos using Apify. These videos were reviewed using MQ-VET by three independent raters. The raters answered additional survey questions to analyze the content of the videos. Thematic analysis was completed using OpenAI GPT-4o, version 1.2024.254.
Results
Of the top 50 TikTok videos populated by the search term “IUD insertion,” 40% support the use of anesthesia for IUD placement. 60% were considered neutral or non-applicable. 48% of the videos were posted by users who appear to be medical doctors, and 46% by laypeople. 25% of videos posted by doctors were combined videos with laypeople, known as a “stitch” or “duet.” 22% of the TikToks featured footage of an IUD insertion, with the patient/creator of the video in visible pain. The most prevalent themes in these TikToks include pain during IUD insertion and removal, anxiety and emotional responses, and coping strategies for pain and discomfort.
Conclusions
This study highlights the potential for TikTok to shape the perception of IUD insertion among young adults and adolescents, with the average number of views reaching almost 2 million. A significant portion of the top videos illustrate visible expressions of pain during IUD insertion, yet little information is shared about the types of pain management available or data supporting its use. This demonstrates the importance of health professionals creating social media videos that further elucidate the types of pain management available, to empower and enhance reproductive health autonomy.}

We constructed directed unipartite networks among Instagram (N = 104) and TikTok (N = 100) influencers and users on Instagram (N = 55,622) and TikTok (N = 68,673) who commented on these influencers' posts in 2021–2022 (including influencers who commented on each other's posts). Comments to posts of users who were not classified as influencers were not collected. The Instagram network was denser (more interconnected) and more active compared to the TikTok network (1.48 times as high density, 281 times as high transitivity, and 86 times as high reciprocity). Both Instagram and TikTok networks contained heterophilic ties (i.e., influencers from different geographic regions such as Asia, North America and Europe connected to each other), indicating that influencers from different geographic regions engage with (comment on) each other's content, potentially exposing audiences to a wide variety of e-cigarette content. Influencers who promote e-cigarettes and post about lifestyle topics (e.g., fitness, fashion, gaming) occupy more central positions in the Instagram and TikTok networks than influencers who focus primarily on e-cigarette promotion, potentially exposing users who are not interested in tobacco-related content to harmful imagery of e-cigarettes. The findings emphasize the need for strengthening influencer marketing regulation on social media platforms popular among youth.}

In this paper, we collect a rich live streaming dataset and identify two categories of social interactions behind live chat: transaction-oriented and relationship-oriented. Broadcasters and viewers in the transaction-oriented category focus on products and transactions and tend to communicate with non-emotional words in live chats. In contrast, broadcasters and viewers might treat each other as friends and are more likely to post emotional words in the relationship-oriented category. Our econometric model shows a curvilinear association between relationship-oriented social interactions and viewer purchase behaviors. The empirical analysis indicates that to achieve higher sales, LSC broadcasters should make relationship-oriented social interactions in live chat account for 58.64% of the probabilities. We discuss the implications of heterogeneous social interaction strategies across different broadcasters.}

abstract = {As social media platforms like TikTok become increasingly popular, patients are turning to them for information about surgical procedures, including orthognathic surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the content quality, reliability, and educational value of videos related to orthognathic surgery on TikTok. A total of 84 videos were analysed using two standardised assessment scales: the modified 5-point DISCERN scale and the Global Quality Score (GQS). These videos were sourced through search terms #JawSurgery and #OrthognathicSurgery, and the data were extracted using a web-scraping tool. The analysis revealed that TikTok videos on orthognathic surgery had a mean DISCERN score of 1.6/5 and a mean GQS of 2.2/5, indicating generally poor quality. Most videos were uploaded by patients (46/84), while 33/84 were by healthcare professionals, particularly maxillofacial surgeons and orthodontists. Despite the high viewership (246 million views across all videos), many videos were limited in content, with 52/84 not containing any information on the procedure, and only 4/84 mentioning risks beyond swelling and bruising. Notably, 82 of the 84 videos had patients interacting in the comments, seeking advice or sharing experiences. While TikTok serves as an important information platform, it also highlights a significant gap in reliable, comprehensive content. Healthcare professionals should direct patients to high quality sources of information that have been approved by them to mitigate the risks of misinformation and anxiety for prospective patients.}

Addressing this gap, we examine political trolling on TikTok by and towards Democrats and Republicans. Based on content analysis of over 8000 comments and posts, we found that trolling comments on TikTok are more humoristic than malevolent, particularly on Democrats’ posts, and that more trolling comments target posts by Democrats than posts by Republicans. We also found that trolling comments target their own party and politicians more often than they target their political opponents, and that more trolling comments that target such posts are humoristic, while more trolling comments that target their opponents are malevolent. Even though the extent of trolling comments on Republicans’ posts is higher than on Democrats’ posts, Democrats are the target of trolling more often, both on their own posts and on Republicans’ posts. Furthermore, Republicans’ posts target Democrats more often than they promote their own agenda, but Democrats’ posts promote their own agenda more often than they target Republicans. We contribute evidence of political trolling on TikTok that reflects the US’ asymmetric politics and politainment, and that raises the need to conduct more nuanced research on the relationships between trolling perpetrators and their targets.}

abstract = {Purpose
TikTok is increasingly becoming a source of health information, peer support, and validation regarding mental health. The goal of this study was to analyze the content of TikTok videos related to depression and anxiety.
Methods
The sample included 100 videos, each with at least a million views, discussing either depression, anxiety, or both. The videos were retrieved from hashtag searches. The videos were coded for the type of mental health condition; specific content being discussed (e.g., symptoms or treatment); video presentation (i.e., personal experience, expert information, or general discussion), and more subcategories. Engagement statistics (i.e., likes, views, reposts, and number of comments) for each video were also recorded.
Results
The engagement statistics were higher for personal experience videos than for videos from healthcare professionals. Anxiety was the subject of 57% of the videos irrespective of the search hashtags, and over two-thirds of the videos were created by females. The most discussed topics included the description or enactment of depression/anxiety symptoms (e.g., emotional displays); mention of being diagnosed by a healthcare professional was the least prevalent.
Discussion
These results suggest that depression and anxiety videos featuring personal experiences are prevalent on TikTok with higher engagement compared to similar videos by health professionals. The attribution of generic symptoms to these mental health conditions may result in self-diagnosis. There is a need for more strategic efforts to ensure quality of health content on TikTok and increased focus on digital health literacy to make young social media users critical consumers of online content.}

Ostomates suffer from multiple comorbidities and social stigma, which can be especially debilitating in young patients. TikTok has become a popular platform for this population to establish a community and gain resources. This study aims to characterize intestinal ostomy videos on TikTok.
Methods
The top 50 videos for search terms “ileostomy,” “colostomy,” “ostomy,” and “stoma” were queried on TikTok. Information was compiled regarding the videos’ creators, content type, overall sentiment, and viewer engagement.
Results
A total of 113 videos amongst 38 creators garnered 52,021,700 likes and 370,983 comments. Most videos focused on education (45.5%) and personal stories (22.7%). Creators were predominantly young females (82.0%), with minimal input from healthcare professionals (3% of videos). Sixty-nine (61%) of videos had responses with further questions.
Conclusions
Our study reveals a gap between interest and availability of professional educational material regarding intestinal ostomies. Addressing this deficiency may improve patient acceptance, bystander understanding, and its negative stigma.}

abstract = {Introduction
Physicians aim to provide optimal care, considering patient experiences and satisfaction. Traditional in-clinic surveys assessing surgical experiences face numerous limitations, including response bias, and inadequate inclusion of diverse demographics. Social media is an emerging platform for patients to share their healthcare experiences, providing an alternative method for gathering patient feedback. This study explores the prevalent themes of moyamoya disease experiences shared on social media.
Methods
Posts containing "#moyamoya" and "#moyamoyawarrior" from Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter were analyzed. Posts unrelated to direct patient experiences were excluded. Relevant posts were categorized by themes and analyzed based on the platform, gender, and identity of the poster (patient or someone else). Chi-squared tests were used to determined significance of theme prevalence.
Results
Of the 1,005 social media posts analyzed, 63.8 % were by patients, and 75.0 % were by females. Most patients (83.0 %) had undergone one surgery. Instagram posts most often focused on Recovery/Rehabilitation (69.7 %), Survival (66.7 %), and Spreading Positivity (45.8 %), while TikTok posts more frequently discussed Survival (97.2 %), Recovery/Rehabilitation (81.3 %), and Spreading Positivity (84.1 %) (p < 0.001). Females were less likely to post on these themes than males, who discussed religious topics more frequently (p = 0.029). Patients discussed appearance (p < 0.001), resiliency (p = 0.002), and quality of life (p = 0.014) more than their loved ones.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates social media's use among moyamoya patients, and can supplement traditional methods of obtaining patient feedback. Despite limitations, leveraging social media can enhance understanding patient needs, ultimately improving care quality for Moyamoya disease patients.}

abstract = {Background
Usefulness of hysteroscopic metroplasty to improve reproductive outcomes is controversial and debated among reproductive specialists and, consequently, patients.
Methods
We performed a cross-sectional analysis to assess the quality, reliability, and level of misinformation in YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok videos about hysteroscopic metroplasty. Videos on each social network retrieved using “hysteroscopy” and “septate uterus” or “uterine septum” as keywords were assessed using Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for audio-visual (PEMAT A/V) content, the modified DISCERN (mDISCERN), Global Quality Scale (GQS), Video Information and Quality Index (VIQI) and Misinformation assessment.
Results
One hundred fifteen videos (47 from YouTube, 35 from TikTok, and 33 from Instagram) were included. Median PEMAT A/V Understandability and Actionability scores were 50.0 % (IQR: 0–63.3) and 20 % (IQR: 0.0–50.0). Actionability was higher YouTube relative to TikTok and Instagram (50.0 % [IQR: 0–75.0] vs. 0 % [IQR: 0–66.0]; p < 0.001 and 0 % [IQR: 0–33.0], p < 0.001), with no significant differences for Understandability. Median mDISCERN was 3 (IQR: 0–3), with higher score for YouTube compared to TikTok and Instagram (3 [IQR: 0–3] vs. 0 [IQR: 0–23], p < 0.001 and 1 [IQR 0–3.0], p < 0.001 respectively). VIQI showed low-level content (median 9; IQR: 4–19) and no differences among social media platforms. GQS was low (median 2 [IQR 1–4.5]), with no differences in subgroup analysis. Videos on YouTube (97.9 %) and TikTok (62.9 %) favored hysteroscopic metroplasty, while Instagram content was against in 63.6 % of cases (p < 0.001). While most videos were found to be either completely or partially accurate, significant differences in misinformation levels were observed across platforms, with YouTube exhibiting the lowest rate of inaccuracies compared to TikTok and Instagram. (8.5 % vs. 42.9 % and 36.4 %; p < 0.001, respectively).
Conclusion
Quality of social networks’ videos on hysteroscopic metroplasty seems unsatisfactory, but with low levels of misinformation. YouTube and TikTok were more favorable than Instagram regarding the usefulness of metroplasty.

Filmed in different styles and set to different music, these videos all feature parents caring for their children by acting upon their bodies as they insert, inject, remove, and reconfigure the biotechnologies of diabetes management. Building from recent studies that show that parents share the embodiment of their children's type 1 diabetes as stress and anxiety related to managing a potentially fatal condition, this article explores how parents use TikTok to visibilize interembodiment. In TikTok videos, interembodiment hinges on shared disease management rather than shared disease symptom or etiology. Moving from the position that people do not simply possess bodies but continually enact them, we explore how parents and children jointly enact diabetes through an entanglement of bodies, voices, medical technologies, and social media personae that appear in #diabetictoddler and #type1mom TikToks. Given some of these videos have circulated to millions of people, we propose that TikTok and other social media platforms provide unique forums for type 1 parents to make their interembodiment visible, perhaps even as a salve for the distress they suffer as they manage their children's illnesses.}

abstract = {Background
Adolescence is a critical period for lifelong health, which makes access to accurate and comprehensive sexuality education essential. As video platforms become a primary source of information for adolescents, the quality of their content significantly impacts their physical and mental health.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the quality, reliability, understandability, and actionability of adolescent sexuality education videos on major Chinese platforms (Bilibili, TikTok or Douyin, and Kwai), analyze associated user comment sentiment and topics, identify predictors of quality and reliability, and provide recommendations.
Methods
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted (April 2025) on the top 100 comprehensively ranked comprehensive sexuality education videos (N=300 total) retrieved from each platform using the keyword 青春期性教育 (“adolescent sexuality education”). Videos were assessed using the Global Quality Score, modified DISCERN, and Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT-U/A), with interrater reliability assessed via Cohen κ. A corpus of over 49,000 user comments underwent sentiment analysis (fine-tuned RoBERTa) and topic modeling (BERTopic, yielding 29 topics grouped into 6 themes). Statistical analyses included Kruskal-Wallis H tests, Spearman correlations, and stepwise linear regressions (SPSS [version 27.0]; P<.05).
Results
Video quality and reliability were moderate on Bilibili and TikTok but generally poor on Kwai. Content from verified sources (physicians, educators, and institutional media) demonstrated superior quality and stability compared to highly variable content from individual media (the predominant source type, especially on Kwai; 87/100, 87%). Paradoxically, Kwai exhibited the highest user engagement despite the lowest quality scores. Understandability (PEMAT-U) was consistently the strongest positive predictor for both quality (Global Quality Score, final model adjusted R2=0.383, β=0.485) and reliability (modified DISCERN, final model adjusted R2=0.209, β=0.319). Actionability (PEMAT-A) and video duration were also significant positive predictors. Understandability scores (PEMAT-U) were generally high (approximately 69%), while actionability scores (PEMAT-A) were moderate to low (33%-50%). Sentiment analysis revealed that comments were predominantly neutral (35,372/49,680, 71.2%), with negative comments (9141/49,680, 18.4%) significantly outweighing positive ones (5167/49,680, 10.4%). Key discussion themes identified included sources of knowledge acquisition, sexual safety and prevention, physiology, and sexual health and practices.
Conclusions
While online video platforms offer accessible channels for adolescent sexuality education in China, the current content is often of moderate-to-poor quality, with questionable reliability and limited actionability. Understandability is paramount, but high engagement does not necessarily correlate with high quality or reliability, potentially amplifying misinformation. To effectively empower youth, critical steps include enhancing content quality by adhering to evidence-based frameworks like the International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education; strengthening platform accountability through improved verification and algorithms; and promoting user media literacy. These measures aim to foster a healthier and more equitable future for Chinese adolescents, helping to achieve goals related to sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy prevention and promoting more open societal attitudes toward sexuality.}

TikTok has increasingly become a source of information about reproductive health. Patients seeking health information about oral contraception on TikTok may be influenced by videos containing misinformation or biased information.
Objective
This social media infodemiological study aims to provide a descriptive content analysis of the quality and reliability of oral contraceptive health information on TikTok.
Study Design
Researchers screened 1,000 TikTok videos from December 2022 to March 2023 retrieved under various search terms related to oral contraceptives. Data, including engagement metrics such as views, likes, comments, saves, and shares, were recorded. Video content including contraceptive methods discussed, efficacy, tolerability, and side effects were recorded. Two reviewers independently used a modified DISCERN criteria and Global Quality Scale (GQS) to assess the quality and reliability of information for each video.
Results
Five hundred seventy-four videos were analyzed after applying exclusion criteria. Videos had a median length of 27 seconds (Q1=13sec, Q3=57sec) and received a median of 35,000 total views (Q1=4856 views, Q3=411,400 views) and 166 views per day (Q1=28 views per day, Q3=2021 views per day). Video creators were 83.3% female and 58.7% white. The mean modified DISCERN score was 1.63 (SD=1.06) and the mean GQS score was 2.28 (SD=1.37). Video creators were 83.3% female and 58.7% white. The mean modified DISCERN score was 1.63 (SD=1.06) and the mean GQS score was 2.28 (SD=1.37). The most common topic discussed in the videos was the effects of contraception. Healthcare professionals had significantly higher DISCERN and GQS scores (p<.001) than non-healthcare professionals. However, they received fewer views, likes, and comments on their videos (p<.001). Healthcare professionals were 86 times more likely than non-healthcare professionals to post educational videos (p<.001). However, non-educational content received significantly more views, likes, and comments than educational content (p<.001).
Conclusion
TikTok videos related to oral contraceptive health had low quality and reliability of information. The majority of videos were made by non-healthcare providers, and the most common topic discussed was the effects of contraception. Videos made by healthcare professionals contained more reliable contraceptive information, but received less engagement than videos made by non-healthcare professionals. Healthcare providers should consider the prevalence of poor-quality information about oral contraceptives on social media when counseling and educating patients about reproductive health.}

Objective
The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to describe TikTok content with the hashtag #occupationaltherapy and investigate how occupational therapy is portrayed.
Methods
We performed a content analysis on the top 500 TikTok videos under the hashtag #occupationaltherapy. We analyzed occupational therapy content themes (occupational therapy intervention, education, student training, universal design, and humor), practice settings (pediatrics, generalists, dementia, hand therapy, neurology, occupational therapy students, older adults, mental health, and unknown), and sentiments (positive, negative, and neutral).
Results
The videos in our sample (n=500) received 175,862,994 views. The 2 most prevalent content areas were education (n=210) and occupational therapy interventions (n=146). The overall sentiment of the videos was positive (n=302). The most frequently observed practice settings in the videos were pediatrics (n=131) and generalists (n=129). Most videos did not state that it was occupational therapy (n=222) or misused the hashtag (n=131).
Conclusions
TikTok has the potential for occupational therapists to share innovations, build communities of practice, and engage in collaborative efforts to share information about occupational therapists’ unique roles with diverse populations. Future research is needed to monitor the quality of information and debunk inaccuracies.}

Limited academic literature has reviewed the usefulness of Instagram and TikTok, which degree students extensively use. Considering this gap, our research group has undertaken a study aimed at elucidating the perspectives of health sciences university students regarding the referred social media as learning tools.
Methods
An online 23-question survey was distributed to undergraduate health sciences degree students across three Spanish universities. The questions were primarily related to the general usage of social media within the university educational environment, but they focused on Instagram and TikTok.
Results
Students identified Instagram (68%) and YouTube (39%) as the most comfortable social networks for learning. Seventy-five percent of students indicated that they followed Instagram accounts about medicine or nursing, with 47% of these accounts lacking apparent university affiliations. One in three students followed TikTok accounts associated with medicine or nursing, with 63% of these accounts appearing to be non-university affiliated.
Conclusions
Medical and nursing students are interested in seeking practical supplementary learning content from non-academic sources, particularly on the newest social networks like Instagram and TikTok. Improving the understanding of such content by university faculty can improve the guidance offered to students of such information.
Resumen
Introducción
Existe una limitada literatura académica en relación con la utilidad de Instagram y TikTok, que sin embargo son muy utilizadas por los estudiantes de grado. Teniendo en cuenta esto, nuestro grupo de investigación ha llevado a cabo un estudio destinado a evaluar la percepción de los estudiantes universitarios de ciencias de la salud con respecto a las referidas redes sociales como herramientas de aprendizaje.
Métodos
Se distribuyó una encuesta en línea de 23 preguntas a estudiantes de grado de ciencias de la salud de tres universidades españolas. Las preguntas estaban relacionadas principalmente con el uso general de las redes sociales en el entorno educativo universitario, pero se centraron en Instagram y TikTok.
Resultados
Los estudiantes identificaron Instagram (68%) y YouTube (39%) como las redes sociales más cómodas para aprender. El 75% de los estudiantes indicó que seguía cuentas de Instagram sobre medicina o enfermería, y el 47% de estas cuentas carecían de afiliaciones universitarias aparentes. Uno de cada tres estudiantes seguía cuentas de TikTok asociadas con medicina o enfermería, y el 63% de estas cuentas parecían no estar afiliadas a la universidad.
Conclusiones
Los estudiantes de medicina y enfermería están interesados en buscar contenido práctico complementario de aprendizaje en fuentes no académicas, en particular en las redes sociales más nuevas como Instagram y TikTok. Mejorar la comprensión de dicho contenido, en particular por parte del profesorado universitario, puede mejorar la orientación ofrecida a los estudiantes de dicha información.}

Prevalence and spread of misinformation are a concern for the exacerbation of vaccine hesitancy and a resulting reduction in vaccine intent. However, few studies have focused on how vaccine misinformation diffuses online, who is responsible for the diffusion, and the mechanisms by which that happens. In addition, researchers have rarely investigated this in non-Western contexts particularly vulnerable to misinformation.
Objective
This study aims to identify COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, map its diffusion, and identify the effect of echo chamber users on misinformation diffusion on a Taiwanese online forum.
Methods
The study uses data from a popular forum in Taiwan called PTT. A crawler scraped all threads on the most popular subforum from January 2021 until December 2022. Vaccine-related threads were identified through keyword searching (n=5818). Types of misinformation, including misleading, disinformation, conspiracy, propaganda, and fabricated content, were coded by 2 researchers. Polarity was proposed as a proxy for measuring an individual’s level of involvement in the echo chamber, one of the mechanisms responsible for the viral misinformation on social media. Factors related to information diffusion, including misinformation type and polarity, were then assessed with negative binomial regression.
Results
Of 5818 threads, 3830 (65.8%) were identified as true information, and 1601 (27.5%) contained misinformation, yielding 5431 boards for analysis. Misinformation content did not vary much from other contexts. Propaganda-related information was most likely to be reposted (relative risk: 2.07; P<.001) when comparing to true information. However, the more polarized a user was, the less likely his or her content was to be reposted (relative risk: 0.22; P<.001). By removing the nodes with a high level of indegree, outdegree, and betweenness centrality, we found that the core network and the entire network demonstrated a decreasing trend in average polarity score, which showed that influential users contributed to the polarization in misinformation consumption.
Conclusions
Although the forum exhibits a resilience to echo chambering, active users and brokers contribute significantly to the polarization of the community, particularly through propaganda-style misinformation. This popularity of propaganda-style misinformation may be linked to the political nature of the forum, where public opinion follows “elite cues” on issues, as observed in the United States. The work in this study corroborates this finding and contributes a data point in a non-Western context. To manage the echo chambering of misinformation, more effort can be put into moderating these users to prevent polarization and the spread of misinformation to prevent growing vaccine hesitancy.}

abstract = {Background
TikTok serves as a social media platform for fostering social empowerment and facilitating community discussions. Recent research indicates that autistic adults use TikTok to share insights into their diagnoses. Adding to this line of inquiry, the current study examines the diagnostic journey of autistic women as shared on TikTok.
Method
Personal narratives of autistic women regarding their diagnostic experiences as shared on TikTok were identified and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2021) to inductively identify shared themes.
Results
Data related to theme I (i.e., “I have spent my whole life trying to fix myself”), II (i.e., “No one realized I was struggling”), and III (i.e., “This isn’t how it should be”) was consistent with other research examining the experiences of autistic women in their diagnostic journey. Theme IV (i.e., “You know yourself better than anyone”) provided unique findings with regard to the TikTok community. Specifically, content creators used TikTok as a platform for communal discourse and social empowerment. They provided and sought reciprocal support and direction.
Conclusions
Autistic women are turning to TikTok to share experiences and express perspectives. The data informs professionals on how to support women in their journey toward understanding themselves within an autistic identity.}

Postpartum individuals may be especially susceptible to body image dissatisfaction, with pressure to “bounce back” to their pre-pregnancy shape and weight, yet there is limited understanding of the type of appearance-related content these individuals are exposed to on social media sites such as TikTok. To better characterize this content, we conducted a content analysis of TikTok videos (N = 286) using #PostpartumBody. We evaluated participant characteristics as well as the presence of positive and negative appearance-related messaging. A lack of diversity was observed among videos, with the majority being coded as White and in the “healthy” body mass index range. Fifty-one percent of the videos had themes related to positive body image, over half involved negative body image themes (e.g., glorifying weight loss), and about one-quarter of videos included both positive and negative themes. The results of this study increase our understanding of both postpartum and appearance-related TikTok videos found on social media. Aligned with the effects of other appearance-related social media content, the type of content shared under the #PostpartumBody hashtag may contribute to poorer body image and psychological health during the postpartum period. Additional research to explore the effects of viewing this content is needed.}

abstract = {Background
Disinformation on social media can seriously affect mental health by spreading false information, increasing anxiety, stress, and confusion in vulnerable individuals, as well as perpetuating stigma. This flood of misleading content can undermine trust in reliable sources and heighten feelings of isolation and helplessness among users.
Objective
This study aimed to explore the phenomenon of disinformation about mental health on social media and provide recommendations to mental health professionals that would use social media platforms to create educational videos about mental health topics.
Methods
A comprehensive analysis conducted on 1000 TikTok videos from more than 16 countries, available in English, French, and Spanish, covering 26 mental health topics. The data collection was conducted using a framework on disinformation and social media. A multilayered perceptron algorithm was used to identify factors predicting disinformation. Recommendations to health professionals about the creation of informative mental health videos were designed as per the data collected.
Results
Disinformation was predominantly found in videos about neurodevelopment, mental health, personality disorders, suicide, psychotic disorders, and treatment. A machine learning model identified weak predictors of disinformation, such as an initial perceived intent to disinform and content aimed at the general public rather than a specific audience. Other factors, including content presented by licensed professionals such as a counseling resident, an ear-nose-throat surgeon, or a therapist, and country-specific variables from Ireland, Colombia, and the Philippines, as well as topics such as adjustment disorder, addiction, eating disorders, and impulse control disorders, showed a weak negative association with disinformation. In terms of engagement, only the number of favorites was significantly associated with a reduction in disinformation. Five recommendations were made to enhance the quality of educational videos about mental health on social media platforms.
Conclusions
This study is the first to provide specific, data-driven recommendations to mental health providers globally, addressing the current state of disinformation on social media. Further research is needed to assess the implementation of these recommendations by health professionals, their impact on patient health, and the quality of mental health information on social networks.}

We collect real world data including live streaming danmaku, user stay time, sales from the Douyin live streaming e-commerce platform (the Chinese version of TikTok). Quantifying user-user interaction with BERT model, we then perform a sentiment analysis using the Baidu API. The results of our analysis demonstrate that entertainment-type and information-type user interaction have a significant positive effect on flow, including user stay time, number of danmaku, number of people sending danmaku. Our study also identifies that number of danmaku and number of people sending danmaku play a partial mediating role between user interactions and live streaming sales. Furthermore, we find that user sentiment plays a positive moderating role in the relationships between several flow variables and user purchase behavior. Theoretically, our study proposes a new method to empirically analyze user behavior in live streaming e-commerce. Practically, in light of these findings, we propose several optimization strategies to enhance the interaction functions of live streaming commerce, so as to enhance user experience and stimulate purchase intention.}

abstract = {Introduction
The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) developed a clinical consensus on ankyloglossia in children to improve understanding of controversies and increase family-centered care. The breadth of information on ankyloglossia available on social media and the consistency with AAO-HNSF consensus remains underexplored.
Methods
A cross-sectional analysis was performed on the top 100 publicly available TikTok videos using the search term “tongue tie.” Video metrics and stakeholders were determined and were classified as informational, anecdotal, promotional, advice-seeking, or entertainment. Informational content was compared to the AAO-HNSF consensus statements on ankyloglossia.
Results
The mean number of views for the top videos on ankyloglossia was 1.4 million (SD: 2.6 million) with a mean of 88,009 “likes” (SD: 250,136) and 781 comments (SD: 1805). Only 2% of videos were created by otolaryngologists but dentists, lactation consultants, and other physicians were frequently represented. Videos were classified as informational (41%) or anecdotal (41%) and the most frequent stakeholder was an adult impacted by ankyloglossia (37%). The top theme explored was frenotomy experience for both written (20%) and audio (15%) information. Among informational videos, only 12.5% were completely consistent with AAO-HNSF consensus while most videos (41%) presented information that was partially consistent with consensus statements.
Conclusions
Ankyloglossia is frequently discussed on social media and families often engage with information shared by non-otolaryngologists. Providers should recognize where themes may be inconsistent with the published consensus on ankyloglossia and develop strategic approaches to achieve the AAO-HNSF goal of family-centered care.}

Videos discussing characteristics of diagnoses, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), receive significant engagement. However, concerns have been raised about the spread of misinformation and potential self-diagnosis among viewers of these videos. To assess the accuracy of the information shared, we conducted a content analysis of 100 popular TikTok videos. Our findings showed that 55 % of the characteristics that youth attributed to ADHD in their videos did not align with the DSM-5-TR criteria of this diagnosis. Investigation of the top comments further suggests that the majority of the viewers (59,6 %) identified with the depicted behaviors and experiences. Moreover, most of the top-commenters accepted or even validated that these traits were part of ADHD, even though this was often not the case. Our findings illustrate how youth broaden the ADHD concept on TikTok. This bottom-up psychiatrization may affect the self-image of other young people who identify with this content, as they come to understand their own behaviors through a pathological lens. It additionally raises concerns about the already high demand for health care, as individuals may seek help after self-diagnosing. This study highlights the need to make health care providers, educators and parents aware of the misinformation circulating online about ADHD. This would enable them to better support youth and help them to be critical of mental health content they encounter on social media.}

abstract = {Background
Transgender and gender diverse people often turn to online platforms for information and support regarding gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT); however, analysis of this social media content remains scarce.
Objective
We characterized GAHT-related videos on TikTok to highlight the implications relevant to GAHT prescribers.
Methods
We used a web scraper to identify TikTok videos posted under the hashtags #genderaffirminghormonetherapy and #genderaffirminghormones as of November 2023. We identified recurrent themes via qualitative content analysis and assessed health education videos with the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audiovisual Materials (PEMAT-A/V) scale and a modified Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose (CRAAP) test.
Results
Out of 69 videos extracted, 71% (49/69) were created by GAHT users, 24.6% (17/69) were created by health care workers, and 21.7% (15/69) were created to provide health education. Themes included physical changes on testosterone, GAHT access, and combating misinformation and stigma surrounding GAHT. Health education videos scored highly on PEMAT-A/V items assessing understandability (mean 88.3%, SD 11.3%) and lower on actionability (mean 60.0%, SD 45.8%). On the CRAAP test, videos scored highly on the relevance, authority, and purpose domains but lower on the currency and accuracy domains.
Conclusions
Discussions of GAHT on TikTok build community among transgender and gender diverse users, provide a platform for digital activism and resistance against legislation that limits GAHT access, and foster patient-provider dialogue. Educational videos are highly understandable and are created by reliable sources, but they vary in terms of currency and quality of supporting evidence, and they lack in actionability.}

abstract = {Background
Experiencing a traumatic event can significantly impact mental and emotional well-being. Social media platforms offer spaces for sharing stories, seeking support, and accessing psychoeducation. TikTok (ByteDance), a rapidly growing social media platform, is increasingly used for advice, validation, and information, although the content of this requires further study. Research is particularly needed to better understand TikTok content relating to trauma and the potential implications for young viewers, considering the distressing nature of the subject and the possibility of users experiencing vicarious trauma through exposure to these videos.
Objective
This study aims to explore the content of trauma-related videos on TikTok, focusing on hashtags related to trauma. Specifically, this study analyzes how TikTok videos present information, advice, stories, and support relating to trauma.
Methods
A quantitative cross-sectional descriptive content analysis was performed on TikTok in December 2022. A total of 5 hashtags related to trauma were selected: #trauma, #traumatized, #traumatok, #traumatic, and #traumabond, with the top 50 videos from each hashtag analyzed (total N=250 videos). A standardized codebook was developed inductively to analyze the content of the videos, while an existing generic codebook was used to collect the video features (eg, age of people in the video) and metadata (likes, comments, and shares) for each video.
Results
A total of 2 major content themes were identified, which were instructional videos (54/250, 21.6%) and videos disclosing personal stories (168/250, 67.3%). The videos garnered significant engagement, with a total of 296.6 million likes, 2.3 million comments, and 4.6 million shares, indicating that users find this content engaging and useful. Alarmingly, only 3.7% (9/250) of videos included a trigger warning, despite many featuring highly distressing stories that young people and those with trauma may be exposed to.
Conclusions
The study highlights the potential risks of vicarious trauma due to trauma dumping without trigger warnings on TikTok, and the need for further research to assess the accuracy of advice and information in these videos. However, it also underscores the platform’s potential to foster social connections, provide validation, and reduce stigma around mental health issues. Public health professionals should leverage social media to disseminate accurate mental health information, while promoting user education and content moderation to mitigate potential harms. People often use social media, such as TikTok to share advice, stories, and support around mental health, including their experiences with trauma. Out of 250 videos, most were either giving advice (54/250, 21.6%) or sharing personal experiences (168/250, 67.3%). The study found many videos lacked warnings about upsetting content, which could potentially harm young viewers or people suffering from trauma. While TikTok can help people feel connected and reduce the stigma around mental health, it is important to seek support from professionals when needed.}

A key social networking site for teachers, TikTok offers a new and valuable lens on educator attrition. This study aims to explore social media’s role in the increased transparency around leaving the profession and the online narratives crafted around transitioning out of the classroom.
Design/methodology/approach
Drawing on the conceptual framework of emergent storytelling and a recursive thematic analysis of videos and comments posted to the #teacherquittok hashtag on TikTok, this study examines how teachers are using social media to share their experiences of exiting the classroom.
Findings
The authors find that teachers used TikTok to share personal accounts that form a meta-narrative that provides context to their decisions to leave, share stories of loss and gain through negotiating the transition out of the classroom and finally debate the implications for preservice teachers. The authors discuss key takeaways for rethinking teacher support, teacher education and the role of social media in teachers’ professional lives.

abstract = {Introduction
Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. It leads to severe maternal and neonatal complications, including fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and maternal death. Affecting approximately 1 in 25 pregnancies worldwide, timely detection and education are crucial for improved birthing outcomes. With over a billion active users, TikTok is a rapidly growing social media platform for information dissemination. As health professionals consider using TikTok to share health content, concerns about the accuracy and quality of information have emerged. While previous studies have assessed health content on platforms like YouTube and Instagram, no studies have specifically evaluated preeclampsia-related videos on TikTok. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy, clarity, and comprehensiveness of preeclampsia-related content on TikTok.
Methods
This study is a cross-section content analysis of publicly available preeclampsia-related videos on TikTok. Using the APIFY TikTok extractor, we retrieved all relevant videos on November 13, 2024 based on hashtags and captions containing “preeclampsia,” “toxemia,” or “pregnancy hypertension.” The extracted videos were collected in an Excel sheet with all relevant data such as uploader type, content type, and engagement metrics. Our exclusion criteria were applied and the Excel sheet was updated as such. Two independent reviewers assessed quality using the Modified DISCERN tool, JAMA benchmark, and Global Quality Score. The ACOG bulletin on preeclampsia served as the gold standard for content veracity.
Results
A total of 147 videos met the inclusion criteria. Most were uploaded by non-medical individuals (64.63%), followed by OB/GYNs (14.97%), healthcare non-physicians (14.97%), and other physicians (5.44%). The most common content types were personal experiences (59.86%) and educational videos (35.37%). Videos uploaded by OB/GYNs had the highest mean quality scores (Modified Discern Tool= 2.32, GQS= 3.45, and JAMA= 1.39), followed by healthcare non-physicians (Modified Discern Tool= 1.64, GQS= 3.18, and JAMA= 1.30). Non-medical individuals had the lowest quality (Modified Discern Tool= 0.36, GQS= 1.78, and JAMA= 0.98). When assessed by content, educational videos had higher quality scores than personal experience videos (Modified Discern Tool= 1.79 vs 0.32, GQS= 3.16 vs 1.72, and JAMA= 1.26 vs 0.99). Statistically significant differences were found between uploader type and quality scores with healthcare professionals producing higher-quality content than non-medical individuals (P<0.019). Similarly, educational videos were significantly higher in quality than personal experience videos (P<0.000). Interestingly, lower-quality videos had greater engagement (i.e., likes, comments, shares, views) than higher-quality videos (P<0.04).
Conclusion
The quality of preeclampsia-related TikTok videos varies significantly by uploader and content type. Healthcare professionals upload higher-quality educational videos, while non-medical individuals upload lower-quality personal experiences. However, lower quality videos had higher public engagement. These findings emphasize the need for improved regulation of health- related content posted on TikTok and highlight its potential as an educational tool for maternal health.}

Energy drinks (EDs) are not recommended for minors' consumption due to a myriad of health risks, but marketing initiatives persist. This study explored the promotion of EDs on TikTok, a platform frequented by children and adolescents.
Methods
197 highly viewed videos from the four top ED-related hashtags on TikTok were coded for engagement variables, user information, sponsorship status, video content, and sentiment toward EDs.
Results
Of the 197 videos analyzed (combined 70 + million views), 29% disclosed sponsorship and 22% featured a child/adolescent. ED consumption appeared in 46% of videos, with 15% depicting hazardous consumption. Most videos (67%) had a positive sentiment toward EDs.
Discussion
ED-related TikTok videos are positively framed, have high engagement, and are not restricted for viewing by minors. As the platform's underage user-base grows, such videos may encourage heightened consumption. Given the known health risks, effective age-gated content restrictions are needed to reduce minors' exposure.}

Older adults have a high rate of loneliness, which contributes to increased psychosocial risk, medical morbidity, and mortality. Digital emotional support interventions provide a convenient and rapid avenue for additional support. Digital peer support interventions for emotional struggles contrast the usual provider-based clinical care models because they offer more accessible, direct support for empowerment, highlighting the users’ autonomy, competence, and relatedness.
Objective
This study aims to examine a novel anonymous and synchronous peer-to-peer digital chat service facilitated by trained human moderators. The experience of a cohort of 699 adults aged ≥65 years was analyzed to determine (1) if participation, alone, led to measurable aggregate change in momentary loneliness and optimism and (2) the impact of peers on momentary loneliness and optimism.
Methods
Participants were each prompted with a single question: “What’s your struggle?” Using a proprietary artificial intelligence model, the free-text response automatched the respondent based on their self-expressed emotional struggle to peers and a chat moderator. Exchanged messages were analyzed to quantitatively measure the change in momentary loneliness and optimism using a third-party, public, natural language processing model (GPT-4 [OpenAI]). The sentiment change analysis was initially performed at the individual level and then averaged across all users with similar emotion types to produce a statistically significant (P<.05) collective trend per emotion. To evaluate the peer impact on momentary loneliness and optimism, we performed propensity matching to align the moderator+single user and moderator+small group chat cohorts and then compare the emotion trends between the matched cohorts.
Results
Loneliness and optimism trends significantly improved after 8 (P=.02) to 9 minutes (P=.03) into the chat. We observed a significant improvement in the momentary loneliness and optimism trends between the moderator+small group compared to the moderator+single user chat cohort after 19 (P=.049) and 21 minutes (P=.04) for optimism and loneliness, respectively.
Conclusions
Chat-based peer support may be a viable intervention to help address momentary loneliness in older adults and present an alternative to traditional care. The promising results support the need for further study to expand the evidence for such cost-effective options.}

abstract = {Background
TikTok (ByteDance) experienced a surge in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic as a way for people to interact with others, share experiences and thoughts related to the pandemic, and cope with ongoing mental health challenges. However, few studies have explored how youth use TikTok to learn about mental health.
Objective
This study aims to understand how youth used TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic to learn about mental health and mental health support.
Methods
Semistructured interviews were conducted with 21 youths (aged 12-24 years) living in British Columbia, Canada, who had accessed TikTok for mental health information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded, and analyzed using an inductive, data-driven approach.
Results
A total of 3 overarching themes were identified describing youth’s experiences. The first theme centered on how TikTok gave youth easy access to mental health information and support, which was particularly helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic to curb the effects of social isolation and the additional challenges of accessing mental health services. The second theme described how the platform provided youth with connection, as it gave youth a safe space to talk about mental health and allowed them to feel seen by others going through similar experiences. This helped normalize and destigmatize conversations about mental health and brought awareness to various mental health conditions. Finally, the last theme focused on how this information led to action, such as trying different coping strategies, discussing mental health with peers and family, accessing mental health services, and advocating for themselves during medical appointments. Across the 3 themes, youth expressed having to be mindful of bias and misinformation, highlighting the barriers to identifying and reporting misinformation and providing individualized advice on the platform.
Conclusions
Findings suggest that TikTok can be a useful tool to increase mental health awareness, reduce stigma, and encourage youth to learn and address their mental health challenges while providing a source of peer connection and support. Simultaneously, TikTok can adversely impact mental health through repetitive exposure to mentally distressing content and misleading diagnosis and treatment information. Regulations against harmful content are needed to mitigate these risks and make TikTok safer for youth. Efforts should also be made to increase media and health literacy among youth so that they can better assess the information they consume online.}

The indicator correlates weakly with stock returns but significantly with market volatility, aligns with seasonal sentiment patterns, and reflects significant events like COVID-19. Additionally, weekly sentiment trends indicate the lowest sentiment on Thursdays and the highest on Fridays. This study advances financial sentiment analysis by demonstrating the efficacy of multimodal indicators in capturing market sentiment and informing volatility forecasts.}

abstract = {Background
Neuraxial labor analgesia is the most effective method of pain relief during childbirth. Despite its proven efficacy and safety, misconceptions about neuraxial analgesia persist. This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and quality of TikTok videos on neuraxial labor analgesia, hypothesizing that many would contain inaccurate or low-quality information.
Methods
Using the “Top” search function in TikTok, we identified the first 150 videos using the following keywords: “epidural,” “epidural for labor,” “epidural for pregnancy,” “epidural experience,” “getting an epidural,” and “epidural risks.” Primary outcomes included the proportion of videos containing inaccurate information and overall quality of videos based on modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) scores.
Results
Twenty-six (10%) of the 266 included videos contained inaccurate information. Median (interquartile range = IQR) mDISCERN score for all included videos was 1.0 (IQR = 2.0), indicating poor quality. Videos from medical sources scored higher in quality (median = 2.0, IQR = 1.0) than non-medical sources (median = 0.0, IQR = 2.0; P <0.001), however both scores were below the mDISCERN threshold for high video-quality.
Conclusion
This study highlights the presence of inaccurate information on popular social media platforms such as TikTok regarding neuraxial labor analgesia. Many videos are of low quality and lack comprehensive, balanced, and unbiased information. This poses a significant risk to patient understanding and informed decision-making. Medical professionals and organizations should actively engage on platforms such as TikTok to disseminate accurate, high-quality information, thereby helping to combat the spread of misleading information.}

Anxiety in university students can lead to poor academic performance and even dropout. The Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale (AMAS-C) is a validated measure designed to assess the level and nature of anxiety in college students.
Objective
The aim of this study is to provide internet-based alternatives to the AMAS-C in the automated identification and prediction of anxiety in young university students. Two anxiety prediction methods, one based on facial emotion recognition and the other on text emotion recognition, are described and validated using the AMAS-C Test Anxiety, Lie and Total Anxiety scales as ground truth data.
Methods
The first method analyses facial expressions, identifying the six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) and the neutral expression, while the students complete a technical skills test. The second method examines emotions in posts classified as positive, negative and neutral in the students' profile on the social network Facebook. Both approaches aim to predict the presence of anxiety.
Results
Both methods achieved a high level of precision in predicting anxiety and proved to be effective in identifying anxiety disorders in relation to the AMAS-C validation tool. Text analysis-based prediction showed a slight advantage in terms of precision (86.84 %) in predicting anxiety compared to face analysis-based prediction (84.21 %).
Conclusions
The applications developed can help educators, psychologists or relevant institutions to identify at an early stage those students who are likely to fail academically at university due to an anxiety disorder.}

We investigated the potential for these algorithms to exacerbate eating disorder symptoms by analysing 1.03 million TikTok videos delivered to 42 individuals with eating disorders (76 % anorexia nervosa) and 49 healthy controls over one month. Within this video corpus, we identified four video categories relevant to eating disorder psychopathology: appearance-oriented videos, dieting videos, exercise videos, and toxic eating disorder (akin to “pro-anorexia”) videos. Multi-level models predicted the likelihood of users’ algorithms delivering these videos and the likelihood of users “liking” (i.e., volitionally engaging with) these videos. Algorithms belonging to users with eating disorders delivered more appearance-oriented (+146 %), dieting (+335 %), exercise (+142 %), and toxic eating disorder videos (+4343 %). Stronger biases in users’ algorithms toward these videos were associated with more severe eating disorder symptoms. Whilst users with eating disorders were slightly more likely to “like” these problematic video categories (e.g., dieting videos: +23 % versus controls), their algorithms were far more likely to deliver these videos in the first place (dieting videos: +335 % versus controls). Our results provide preliminary evidence that the TikTok algorithm might exacerbate eating disorder symptoms via content personalisation processes that are desensitised to volitional user actions (i.e., “liking” videos).}

abstract = {Background
The proliferation of health-related content on social media platforms has changed the way people access and interpret information about cosmetic medicine. TikTok (ByteDance) has become an important platform for sharing breast enhancement content, yet little is known about the quality, credibility, and impact of such information on user perceptions and decision-making.
Objective
This paper aims to analyze the characteristics of breast enhancement videos, including uploader demographics, product details, promotional claims, and user engagements, to better understand the nature of the claims and products encountered by users.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional content analysis of the top 150 most-liked breast enhancement videos via TikTok’s web interface. The videos were coded according to the uploader’s traits (gender expression and account type), product details (type and scientific evidence), and promotional strategies (testimonials and sponsorship disclosures). Engagement metrics (likes and shares) were recorded, and nonparametric tests (Mann–Whitney U test) were used to compare the engagement between licensed physicians and uncertified content creator uploaders. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all the variables.
Results
Overall, 85 videos were included in the final analysis, with most uploaders presenting a feminine gender expression (59/85, 69.4%) and using uncertified content creator accounts (59/85, 69.4%). The most promoted product types were breast enhancement creams or oils (32/85, 37.6%) and breast implants (22/85, 25.9%). Most videos (71/85, 83.5%) depicted the products positively; however, most videos (78/85, 91.8%) provided no scientific evidence of the product’s efficacy. Engagement metrics revealed that videos by licensed physicians received significantly higher thumbs up (median 9761, IQR 4975-19,492) than uncertified content creator uploaders (median 701, IQR 280‐2604; P=.002). Only one video (1.2%) of the 85 videos included a “before and after” visual component, and most videos (75/85, 88.2%) omitted product purchasing details. Sponsorship disclosures were absent in most of posts (79/85, 92.9%).
Conclusions
TikTok’s short video format fosters widespread and rapid dissemination of breast enhancement information, representing a key strength in democratizing health communication. Its user-friendly interface and visual appeal also offer a valuable avenue for medical professionals to engage audiences more dynamically. However, the lack of rigorous content checks can amplify misleading or unverified claims. To address these weaknesses, implementing dual-mode content review could be essential for maximizing TikTok’s capacity to support informed public health decision-making.}

This study aimed to explore the possible influence of TikTok short-video application on the education of surgical patients.
Methods
A systematic search was performed in compliance with the PRISMA checklist. The research protocol was registered with the PROSPERO register (CRD42024551646). A search was performed in the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases from inception to 2024. The search terms used were “TikTok AND Surgery,” “TikTok AND Surgical Education,” and “TikTok AND surgery AND patient."
Results
The present systematic search resulted in 697 citations, of which 50 relevant citations were included. The search revealed that TikTok has widely used among patients from different surgical specialties and has an influence on their education. The platform facilitates public health awareness, allowing surgeons to share educational content, including surgical techniques and patient-oriented information.
Conclusion
As one of the rapidly growing social media platforms, TikTok is increasingly utilised to disseminate health information. It has been adopted across various surgical specialties. While the platform presents a great opportunity to improve the education of surgical patients, it presents challenges related to the accuracy of information, potential misinformation, and lack of regulation. Surgeons and healthcare professionals should actively participate in creating accurate, evidence-based content that enhances patient education and promotes public health awareness.}

However, there is a scarcity of systematic research presenting the Chinese public's sentiments regarding the “substituting plastic with bamboo” policy. With the increasing use of social media platforms for expressing views on policies, this research employs web crawler technology to collect public data from TikTok, Bilibili, and Sina Weibo, and uses statistical analysis and text mining techniques for investigation. The findings indicate that public discourse is strongly influenced by the announcement of related national policies. Commonly identified keywords in the analysis include “plastic bag,” “cut,” “chopsticks,” “moldy,” “single use,” “garbage,” and “buy.” Sentiment analysis reveals that neutral sentiments account for more than one-third of all comments, with positive sentiments marginally outnumbering the negative ones. The negative sentiments predominantly express concerns about the quality and cost of bamboo wares, environmental repercussions, and policy implementation challenges. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic analysis, six key topics were identified based on Coherence and Jensen-Shannon Divergence metrics: economic environmental impact, the feasibility of substitution, impact on daily life, utilization of bamboo wares, production challenges, and policy implications. This research concludes with several policy recommendations. The insights gained from this research can assist the Chinese government and bamboo ware manufacturers in understanding market dynamics and in crafting more effective policies and strategies.}

abstract = {Objectives
Access to information about abortion is essential for ensuring reproductive autonomy, particularly post-Roe. TikTok, a popular video-sharing application, may be a source of information about abortion, yet little is known about the tone and content of such videos. To fill this gap, we analyze the most liked abortion videos on TikTok three months following the U.S. Supreme Court decision Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.
Study design
We downloaded the top 200 most liked, publicly available TikTok videos when searching “abortion” on September 26, 2022 and recorded and summarized key video characteristics. We then qualitatively analyzed for content, tone, and common themes.
Results
The top 200 most liked TikTok videos collectively had approximately 164 million likes, nearly 10 million shares, and 4 million comments. Most videos expressed support for abortion and presented information that was political or personal in nature. Only two videos contained health information about obtaining or completing an abortion, and only five videos featured or were created by a medical provider.
Conclusions
Findings reveal the far reach of TikTok, which underscores the importance of analyzing online sources of information about abortion. However, our mixed-methods analysis indicates that the most liked TikToks are a source of abortion news, political opinion, personal stories, and debate rather than a source of health information for abortion seekers.
Implications
Our analysis finds that the top 200 most liked TikTok videos three months post-Dobbs are primarily political in nature. Relatively few videos provided practical information about accessing abortion care, presenting an opportunity for healthcare providers, public health advocates, and activists to improve access and awareness of new pathways to care. The most popular TikTok videos appear to disseminate news and political information rather than health information about abortion.}

Hypertrophic scars (HTSs) are a predominant condition after burns and trauma, and it causes severe physiological and psychological problems. TikTok (Douyin in Chinese), a popular platform for sharing short videos, has shown the potential to spread health information, including information related to HTSs. Educating the public to obtain correct information is important to reduce the incidence of physiological and psychological problems caused by HTSs. However, the quality and reliability of HTS-related video content on TikTok in mainland China have not been thoroughly studied.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the content and quality of short videos related to HTSs on the Chinese version of TikTok (Douyin) and explore the factors related to their quality, providing valuable insights for health information dissemination.
Methods
We collected a sample of 153 TikTok videos in Chinese related to HTSs and categorized them according to video source and content. We evaluated the video content using a coding schema, and a hexagonal radar schema was used to intuitively display the spotlight and weight of each aspect of the videos. We evaluated quality using 4 standardized tools: the modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) questionnaire, the Journal of the American Medical Association, the Global Quality Scale (GQS), and the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct. We also explored the potential relationship between video quality and characteristics.
Results
The analysis showed that health care professionals uploaded all videos about treating HTSs, which matched the hexagonal radar model analysis findings. The quality assessment scores for the Journal of the American Medical Association, GQS, mDISCERN, and the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct had median values of 1 (IQR 1-2), 2 (IQR 2-3), 2 (IQR 2-3), and 3 (IQR 3-4), respectively, indicating a need to improve the quality and reliability of videos on HTSs. In addition, high-quality videos were more popular, based on metrics such as likes, comments, favorites, and shares (P<.001). Interestingly, the time when the videos were uploaded positively correlated with GQS and mDISCERN scores (r=0.393; P<.001 and r=0.273; P<.001), while the video length did not significantly correlate with evaluation scores (P=.78, P=.20, P=.07, and P=.04).
Conclusions
The quality of TikTok videos related to HTSs is generally moderate. Users should exercise caution when seeking information on HTSs from TikTok. It is advisable to choose videos uploaded by health care professionals from the burn department and the burn plastic surgery department, and in the Chinese context, those produced in first-tier cities and emerging first-tier cities.}

To investigate themes, quality, and reliability of gynecologic cancer-related content on the social media application TikTok.
Methods
TikTok was systematically searched for the 100 most popular posts for ovarian cancer (OC), endometrial cancer (EC), cervical cancer (CC), vulvar cancer (VC), and gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) in August 2022. Data was collected for demographics, tone, and themes. Educational videos were rated for quality and reliability utilizing the modified DISCERN scale. Relationships between content demographics, disease sites, and themes were assessed.
Results
As of August 2022, the top five hashtags for each gynecologic cancer on TikTok had 466.7 million views. 430 of the top 500 posts were eligible for inclusion (OC: n = 86, CC: n = 93, EC: n = 98, GTD: n = 63, VC: n = 90). The majority of creators (n = 323, 75.1%) were White, 33 (7.7%) were Black, 20 (4.6%) were Asian/Pacific Islander (API), 10 (2.3%) were South Asian, 20 (4.7%) were Hispanic/Latino/a, 24 (5.5%) were unable to determine. Eleven central themes were identified, with significant differences when analyzed by disease site and race. The median DISCERN score for all posts was 1.0, indicating poor educational quality and reliability. When compared by race, South Asian/API posters received the highest scores (3, IQR 2.5) versus Black (2: IQR 3), Hispanic/Latino/a (2: IQR 0), and White posters (1, IQR 2) (p = 0.0013).
Conclusion(s)
Gynecologic cancer-related content on TikTok is of poor educational quality, and racial disparities in gynecologic cancer extend to social media. Opportunities exist to create more diverse content to support racial and cultural experiences in gynecologic cancer treatment.}

abstract = {TikTok, one of the most popular visual social media platforms, has been criticized for perpetuating and glorifying eating disorders. In response, content focused on body positivity (loving your body) is growing on TikTok. However, body positivity content on other social platforms promotes positive body image but also perpetuates unrealistic beauty ideals. Body neutrality (deemphasizing the focus on the body's appearance) is an alternative concept that could portray less harmful content, but has yet to be explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore and compare the content under #BodyPositivity and #BodyNeutrality on TikTok. One hundred and fifty TikToks under each hashtag were downloaded. A thematic analysis of the TikToks was conducted. Three themes were generated that captured content across both hashtags, with only minor differences in content between the two: (1) Resisting societal ideologies (with subtheme: Normalizing insecurities), (2) (Re)producing disordered content (with subtheme: Toxic (body) positivity promotes the need for neutrality), and (3) Social critique. Within the themes, there was the promotion of body positivity through self-love and body acceptance, but also content that continued to emphasize standard beauty ideals and the thin-ideal. Certain TikToks provided educational content that explained the roots of the #BodyPositivity movement and what #BodyNeutrality means as a potentially more realistic approach to body acceptance. Findings suggest that #BodyNeutrality may provide a safer space for individuals online, and future research should assess the impact of such TikToks on those viewing them to assess body and eating attitudes and behaviours.}

abstract = {Background
As social media platforms gain popularity, their usage is increasingly associated with cyberbullying and body shaming, causing devastating effects.
Objective
This study aims to investigate the impact of social media on Generation Z users’ body image satisfaction. More specifically, it examines the impact of TikTok on body image satisfaction among TikTok users aged between 17 years and 26 years in Indonesia.
Methods
The methodology used mixed-method approaches. Quantitative data were obtained from 507 responses to a questionnaire and analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modeling. Qualitative data were obtained from the interviews of 32 respondents and analyzed through content analysis.
Results
This study reveals that upward appearance comparison is influenced by video-based activity and appearance motivation. Conversely, thin-ideal internalization is influenced by appearance motivation and social media literacy. Upward appearance comparisons and thin-ideal internalization comparisons detrimentally impact users’ body image satisfaction.
Conclusions
The results of this study are expected to provide valuable insights for social media providers, regulators, and educators in their endeavors to establish a positive and healthy social media environment for users.}

keywords = {posttraumatic stress disorder, TikTok, social media, health communication, PTSD},
abstract = {Background
TikTok became an increasingly popular platform for mental health discussions during a major global stressor (COVID-19 pandemic). On TikTok, content assumed to promote user engagement is delivered in a hyperindividually curated manner through a proprietary algorithm. Mental health providers have raised concerns about TikTok’s potential role in promoting inaccurate self-diagnoses, pathologizing normal behaviors, and fostering new-onset symptoms after exposure to illness-related content, such as tic-like movements linked to conversion or factitious disorders. The accuracy of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)–related content with respect to conveying symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment deserves further investigation.
Objective
This study aimed to characterize the accuracy of PTSD-related TikTok content.
Methods
In February 2022, a search was conducted on TikTok using the hashtag #PTSD, and the 100 most-liked videos were retrieved. Videos were excluded if they were in a non-English language, duplicated, unrelated to PTSD, lacked audio, or contained nonfunctioning links. A publicly available Python package (TikTokPy) was used to scrape available metadata (views, shares, etc). Using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audiovisual Materials (PEMAT-AV), videos were independently coded by 2 reviewers for the overall accuracy of the video (useful, personal experience, or misleading), whether the creator self-identified as a health care professional, symptoms mentioned, and overall video understandability and actionability. A third reviewer was consulted in the rare instances of coding disagreements.
Results
Of the 100 included videos, 29 were classified as useful, 59 were classified as personal experience (subjective experience without outright inaccuracies), and 12 were classified as misleading. The degree to which PTSD-related information was accurate was not associated with its understandability, actionability, or user engagement. Besides useful videos being longer (mean 88.7, SD 63.1 seconds) than personal experience videos (mean 42.7, SD 44.5 seconds), no group differences in video metadata were observed across the number of views, likes, shares, or comments (P>.05). While self-identified HCPs were more likely to post useful content, they also contributed to 33% (4/12) of misleading videos. Changes in cognition and mood were the most frequently reported symptoms of PTSD (38/100, 38% of videos).
Conclusions
Our findings were roughly consistent with previous studies of mental health–related TikTok content accuracy, although this is variable by diagnosis. TikTok’s continuously adaptive algorithmic content delivery may expose users to nonspecific and potentially misleading “click-bait” mental health information, which could influence symptom interpretation and clinical presentation. Clinicians should be aware of the digital landscape shaping patients’ perceptions of PTSD.

abstract = {Global digital platforms span diverse domains, from social media to online marketplaces, and wield significant influence within their respective sectors. The rise of social media platforms, in particular, has sparked growing concern over their impact on individual behaviour, political discourse, and the management of personal data. These concerns have led to mounting institutional pressure from governments and the public, especially around issues of content curation, moderation, and data security. Responding to such pressures is complex for platforms, as they operate across multiple jurisdictions with overlapping yet often contradictory institutional demands. This paper investigates the institutional pressures faced by social media platforms in host-country contexts, focusing on their influence over users through content moderation and data governance. It examines how these platforms deploy nonmarket strategies to navigate these challenges, using TikTok's operations in the US market as a case study. The findings reveal that despite persistent scrutiny from the US government, TikTok has employed a range of nonmarket actions. These include direct actions such as enhancing content moderation and pursuing legal avenues, as well as indirect approaches like mobilising its user base. This study offers insights into the unique political challenges social media platforms encounter in host-country contexts and highlights the platform-specific strategies they develop to address these pressures.}

abstract = {Objective
The aims of this review are to clarify the current state of research in terms of assessment tools and assessors of the quality of health science-related short videos on TikTok, to identify limitations in existing research; and to provide a reference for future studies.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted. The Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, EBSCO, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Data, and CBM databases were searched from September 2016 to November 2022. Manual searching was also performed to identify additional eligible studies. A total of 2620 documents were initially retrieved, and 29 were ultimately included. The literature was screened and collected, and data were extracted and summarized by 2 researchers.
Results
(1) The quality evaluation tools used in the 29 papers included the DISCERN, PEMAT(A/V), GQS, JAMA, HONcode, guidelines and self-developed tools. Twenty-four of the included articles used the DISCERN for quality assessment, which was the most frequently used evaluation tool. However, most of these tools were not developed to assess health science-related short videos, lacked credibility tests, and had poor applicability; therefore, the accuracy of the evaluation results might be biased. (2) The assessors of the quality of health science-related short videos on TikTok were mainly experts in related fields and medical students, with doctors (12/14) being the most common evaluators. Fifteen studies did not report the identity of the evaluators, and 12 studies did not report interrater reliability.
Conclusion
This scoping review found that there is a lack of specific quality assessment tools for health science-related short videos on TikTok. Second, the current quality assessors of health science-related short videos on TikTok are limited. Future research should focus on the development of reliable, scientific quality assessment tools for health science-related short videos; unifying the evaluation standards; inviting users with different backgrounds and different health literacy levels to conduct quality assessments; exploring the quality assessment of health science-related short videos on TikTok from different perspectives.}

We leverage machine learning classifiers to label knowledge construction phases in 259,508 comments on 114 videos under scientific, educational hashtags on TikTok. We further examine the association between knowledge construction phases and manually coded video characteristics. Overall, the classifiers suggest that comments predominantly serve social, non-knowledge-construction purposes, followed by sharing ideas, negotiating understanding, and exploring idea dissonance. Videos that focus on informational content, leverage original audio, and employ analytic language have higher proportions of comments that share and negotiate knowledge. We discuss considerations for science communicators, to develop content that encourages viewers to socially construct knowledge.}

abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate TikTok videos related to knee injuries, examining the accuracy and sources of the content, the category of information provided, the reach of the videos, and the capability of the videos to cause harm.
Methods
On September 1, 2024, TikTok was queried using layperson’s terms for acute knee injuries (e.g., “ACL tear”) to identify popular hashtags. The top 10 videos per hashtag and 5 videos per search term (e.g., “knee pop”) by view count were included if they related to the specified knee injury, surgery, or recovery process. Videos with fewer than 1,000 views were excluded. Metrics such as number of likes, number of views, number of comments, creator demographic characteristics, and video content type were collected, and videos were evaluated for quality using the DISCERN scoring system.
Results
A total of 234 TikTok videos related to knee injuries were analyzed, averaging 699,235 views per video (median, 138,500 views). DISCERN analysis revealed that 41% of videos were rated as poor whereas 59% were satisfactory. Videos featuring medical recommendations had significantly higher engagement scores (mean, 5.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.49-6.83; P = .001) and longer durations (mean, 53.38 seconds; 95% CI, 44.47-62.28 seconds; P = .002) than those without recommendations (mean score, 3.18 [95% CI, 2.84-3.52]; mean duration, 38.10 seconds [95% CI, 33.18-43.01 seconds]). Satisfactory videos outperformed poor-quality videos across DISCERN metrics, with clearer aims (mean, 3.91 vs 2.72; P < .001), greater relevance (mean, 3.20 vs 2.09; P < .001), and more balanced information (mean, 1.60 vs 1.00; P < .001). Physicians created 24.4% of the videos, which generally scored higher according to the DISCERN criteria than videos created by non–health care–related professionals.
Conclusions
Videos created by health care professionals, particularly physicians, scored higher in terms of educational quality but accounted for a small proportion of total content. In contrast, nonphysician creators frequently provided inaccurate or incomplete information. Despite this, videos with medical recommendations achieved higher engagement.
Clinical Relevance
There is a predominance of nonphysician creators disseminating inaccurate medical information, underscoring the need for orthopaedic surgeons to engage in digital health education to provide reliable content. This study provides insights into the digital content patients may be consuming regarding their medical conditions.}

Cognitive absorption is conceptualized as a second-order construct comprising focused immersion, temporal dissociation, heightened enjoyment, and curiosity. Data were collected from 479 daily TikTok users and analyzed using component-based structural equation modeling. Results show that cognitive absorption is the strongest predictor of problematic use, followed by nomophobia and life stress. Additionally, life stress significantly predicts nomophobia. These findings suggest that optimal user experiences - not just emotional distress - can contribute to problematic app engagement.

abstract = {Background
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and imposes a significant economic burden. TikTok has risen as a favored platform within the social media sphere for disseminating CHD-related information and stands as a pivotal resource for patients seeking knowledge about CHD. However, the quality of such content on TikTok remains largely unexplored.
Objective
This study aims to assess the quality of information conveyed in TikTok CHD-related videos.
Methods
A comprehensive cross-sectional study was undertaken on TikTok videos related to CHD. The sources of the videos were identified and analyzed. The comprehensiveness of content was assessed through 6 questions addressing the definition, signs and symptoms, risk factors, evaluation, management, and outcomes. The quality of the videos was assessed using 3 standardized evaluative instruments: DISCERN, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmarks, and the Global Quality Scale (GQS). Furthermore, correlative analyses between video quality and characteristics of the uploaders and the videos themselves were conducted.
Results
The search yielded 145 CHD-related videos from TikTok, predominantly uploaded by health professionals (n=128, 88.3%), followed by news agencies (n=6, 4.1%), nonprofit organizations (n=10, 6.9%), and for-profit organizations (n=1, 0.7%). Content comprehensiveness achieved a median score of 3 (IQR 2-4). Median values for the DISCERN, JAMA, and GQS evaluations across all videos stood at 27 (IQR 24-32), 2 (IQR 2-2), and 2 (IQR 2-3), respectively. Videos from health professionals and nonprofit organizations attained significantly superior JAMA scores in comparison to those of news agencies (P<.001 and P=.02, respectively), whereas GQS scores for videos from health professionals were also notably higher than those from news agencies (P=.048). Within health professionals, cardiologists demonstrated discernibly enhanced performance over noncardiologists in both DISCERN and GQS assessments (P=.02). Correlative analyses unveiled positive correlations between video quality and uploader metrics, encompassing the positive correlations between the number of followers; total likes; average likes per video; and established quality indices such as DISCERN, JAMA, or GQS scores. Similar investigations relating to video attributes showed correlations between user engagement factors—likes, comments, collections, shares—and the aforementioned quality indicators. In contrast, a negative correlation emerged between the number of days since upload and quality indices, while a longer video duration corresponded positively with higher DISCERN and GQS scores.
Conclusions
The quality of the videos was generally poor, with significant disparities based on source category. The content comprehensiveness coverage proved insufficient, casting doubts on the reliability and quality of the information relayed through these videos. Among health professionals, video contributions from cardiologists exhibited superior quality compared to noncardiologists. As TikTok’s role in health information dissemination expands, ensuring accurate and reliable content is crucial to better meet patients’ needs for CHD information that conventional health education fails to fulfill.}

TikTok specializes in short videos and has become a common source of information for many of its users. To date, only three other studies have characterized the quality and value of popular TikTok content related to orthopedics. This study evaluated the quality and value of the top 100 most liked TikTok videos categorized with #aclrehab.
Methods
A comprehensive search was conducted in TikTok using the search parameter #aclrehab. The top 100 most-liked videos were analyzed by four independent reviewers. Video characteristics and viewer interaction parameters were analyzed as well. Videos were categorized first by source and then further classified as useful, misleading/irrelevant, or personal experience. Useful videos were assessed for reliability and comprehensiveness using a modified 5-point DISCERN scale. Personal experience videos were further categorized into positive, negative, or neutral valence. The overall quality of all videos were assessed, regardless of classification, according to the 5-point Global Quality Scale (GQS).
Results
Of the 100 videos retrieved, 21 videos were classified as useful, 68 as personal experience, and 11 as misleading/irrelevant. The GQS average for useful videos was 3.36 while the GQS averages for personal experience and irrelevant/misleading videos were 1.43 and 1.18 respectively. While significant differences in GQS scores were observed, the overall reliability and comprehensiveness of useful videos scored poorly. For videos categorized as useful, the DISCERN score average was 2.54. For the videos classified as personal experiences, the number of positive, negative, and neutral valenced videos were 14, 20, and 34 respectively.
Conclusion
This study found that the most popular TikTok videos categorized with #aclrehab are mostly personal experiences with little informational value or quality. The study also concluded that of the 21 videos classified as useful, the information regarding ACL rehabilitation is of slightly below moderate quality and reliability.}

TikTok is a social media platform where patients can access and share information about intrauterine devices (IUDs). The primary objective of this study was to identify prominent themes of creators’ experiences with IUDs on TikTok.
Methods
We conducted a quantitative and qualitative assessment of eligible videos that appeared when searching for “IUD” on the TikTok platform between July 2019 and August 2022. Eligible videos contained content relevant to IUDs and were spoken and/or written in English.
Results
Of the 354 videos that met inclusion criteria, the majority were created by users without healthcare expertise (77%) and mentioned personal experiences with IUDs (68%). However, videos that were educational (27%) or created by users with healthcare expertise (23%) averaged more likes and views than other video types. Common content areas included IUD insertion (45%), side effects (31%), and removal (25%). Perceived gaps in knowledge about the insertion procedure and feeling that providers did not adequately prepare patients for the procedure contributed to dissatisfaction with IUD insertion and motivated creators to share their experiences on TikTok. Video creators often relied on information that they found on TikTok to educate themselves about the IUD insertion process and expressed frustration at unacceptable levels of pain during insertion.
Conclusion
Healthcare providers should be aware that adolescent patients who use TikTok have likely seen videos depicting negative experiences with IUDs and be prepared to address patients’ concerns, particularly regarding IUD insertion. Additionally, healthcare providers may use TikTok to educate users about IUDs.}

abstract = {Background
Social media posts that portray vaping in positive social contexts shape people’s perceptions and serve to normalize vaping. Despite restrictions on depicting or promoting controlled substances, vape-related content is easily accessible on TikTok. There is a need to understand strategies used in promoting vaping on TikTok, especially among susceptible youth audiences.
Objective
This study seeks to comprehensively describe direct (ie, explicit promotional efforts) and indirect (ie, subtler strategies) themes promoting vaping on TikTok using a mixture of computational and qualitative thematic analyses of social media posts. In addition, we aim to describe how these themes might play a role in normalizing vaping behavior on TikTok for youth audiences, thereby informing public health communication and regulatory policies regarding vaping endorsements on TikTok.
Methods
We collected 14,002 unique TikTok posts using 50 vape-related hashtags (eg, #vapetok and #boxmod). Using the k-means unsupervised machine learning algorithm, we identified clusters and then categorized posts qualitatively based on themes. Next, we organized all videos from the posts thematically and extracted the visual features of each theme using 3 machine learning–based model architectures: residual network (ResNet) with 50 layers (ResNet50), Visual Geometry Group model with 16 layers, and vision transformer. We chose the best-performing model, ResNet50, to thoroughly analyze the image clustering output. To assess clustering accuracy, we examined 4.01% (441/10,990) of the samples from each video cluster. Finally, we randomly selected 50 videos (5% of the total videos) from each theme, which were qualitatively coded and compared with the machine-derived classification for validation.
Results
We successfully identified 5 major themes from the TikTok posts. Vape product marketing (1160/10,990, 8.28%) reflected direct marketing, while the other 4 themes reflected indirect marketing: TikTok influencer (3775/14,002, 26.96%), general vape (2741/14,002, 19.58%), vape brands (2042/14,002, 14.58%), and vaping cessation (1272/14,002, 9.08%). The ResNet50 model successfully classified clusters based on image features, achieving an average F1-score of 0.97, the highest among the 3 models. Qualitative content analyses indicated that vaping was depicted as a normal, routine part of daily life, with TikTok influencers subtly incorporating vaping into popular culture (eg, gaming, skateboarding, and tattooing) and social practices (eg, shopping sprees, driving, and grocery shopping).
Conclusions
The results from both computational and qualitative analyses of text and visual data reveal that vaping is normalized on TikTok. Our identified themes underscore how everyday conversations, promotional content, and the influence of popular figures collectively contribute to depicting vaping as a normal and accepted aspect of daily life on TikTok. Our study provides valuable insights for regulatory policies and public health initiatives aimed at tackling the normalization of vaping on social media platforms.}

abstract = {Objective
Extensive research has documented the impact of social media use on risk for eating disorders. The present study used a longitudinal design to test the hypotheses that greater disordered eating prospectively predicts increased engagement with content promoting restrictive eating on TikTok. After data collection began, the university initiated a TikTok ban, adding a quasi-experimental design to explore the impact of the ban on engagement with restrictive eating content.
Methods
Female college students (N = 252) between the ages of 18 and 24 years (M = 19.60, SD = 1.26) completed measures of eating pathology and TikTok engagement with restrictive eating content at baseline and at 9-week follow-up.
Results
Higher disordered eating at baseline prospectively predicted greater engagement with restrictive eating content on TikTok at follow-up, but social media engagement did not predict disordered eating. The university ban on TikTok had no impact on engagement with restrictive eating content. Engagement with restrictive eating content and disordered eating increased over time.
Discussion
Individuals with eating pathology may be drawn to portrayals of restrictive diets by creators with idealized body types, prompting algorithms to push this content and creating a harmful cycle between exposure and risk. Interventions embedded within social media may prove more effective in reducing risk for eating disorders than institutional bans attempting to limit social media access.}

abstract = {Objectives
To investigate themes, quality, and reliability of cervical cancer (CC) related Spanish-language content on TikTok as compared to English-language content.
Methods
TikTok was systematically searched for the top 200 Spanish-language and 100 English-language posts for CC in August 2024. Data were collected including creator demographics, timing of posts in relation to diagnosis, tone, intent, and themes. The modified DISCERN, a validated tool including structured questions assessing reliability and of health-related resources was utilized to assess videos with educational intent. Differences were assessed.
Results
There were more physician Spanish-language creators (27.8 %) compared to physician English-language creators (11.00 %, p < 0.001). Most Spanish-language education videos were created by physicians (82.25 %). Spanish-language posts were more likely to feature themes of treatment toxicities (7.5 % vs 1.7 %, p < 0.001), faith (3.7 % vs 0.7 %, p = 0.003), pain (2.0 % vs 0 %, p = 0.001), family support (1.6 % vs 0 %, p = 0.004), hair loss (1.8 % vs 0.3 %, p = 0.039), and long-term treatment sequelae (1.4 % vs 0 %, p = 0.007); and less likely to address themes of diagnosis (11.8 % vs 18.0 %, p < 0.001), fear or anxiety about cancer (3.4 % vs 8.2 %, p = 0.002), impact on sexual function (0.6 % vs 6.1 %, p < 0.001) and parenthood (0 % vs 3.7 %, p < 0.001). The median DISCERN score was 1.42 (Interquartile Range [IQR] 1.33–1.67) and 1.33 (IQR 1.00–1.92), for Spanish and English-language posts, respectively (p = 0.385).
Conclusions
There were significantly more Spanish-language physician creators suggesting a strong interest in physician-driven content. Thematic differences between Spanish-language and English-language posts highlight important differences in experiences. CC-related content is of poor educational quality, regardless of language. Improving TikTok educational content could increase CC awareness and prevention.}

A data set of 256 posts were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively to describe the ideas of these early adopters, how these ideas resonated with viewers, and what these posts revealed about the teachers' practices and attitudes regarding ChatGPT. Our analysis found that these early adopters focused on practical advice on lesson planning and productivity to relieve the stresses of teaching. However, themes relating to tensions beyond the classroom and the changing nature of teaching and learning resonated the most with viewers.}
