abstract = {One of the research domains in the field of sentiment analysis is automatic emotion recognition in texts which is a worthy topic in human-computer interaction. Text processing has always faced many challenges. The main one is the structural and semantic differences of sentences which have had a significant impact on the malfunction of auto-recognition systems. This problem becomes more prominent in short texts in which words and their concurrences are limited and insufficient. As a result of this, word frequency and TF-IDF weighing cannot well represent the relationship between words and the appropriate feature vector, leading to an undesirable accuracy of emotion recognition. Thus, different strategies should be applied to improve the feature vector and to formulate the features properly. The desired strategy should be able to identify the words that can distinguish between classes well and also to find the relationships between words and meaningful phrases using natural language processing concepts. In this paper, a combination of emotional models, categorical and hierarchical, are used for an emotional text recognition which could discover simultaneously explicit and implicit emotion in a short text. Our approach called DuFER, proposed a weighed method which improves the feature vector using language models and computational linguistics through applying a modified TF-IDF weighing to words as well as Maximum Likelihood Estimation weighing to expressions. Four implicit and explicit emotion datasets are used for the experiments. The results show that the accuracy of both implicit and explicit emotion recognition has increased and DuFER is actually the first successful dual framework in recognizing implicit and explicit emotions from text.}

abstract = {Toxicity detection algorithms, originally designed for reactive content moderation systems, are being deployed into proactive end-user interventions to moderate content. Yet, there has been little critique on the use of these algorithms within this moderation paradigm. We conducted design workshops with four stakeholder groups, asking participants to embed a toxicity detection algorithm into an imagined mobile phone keyboard. This allowed us to critically explore how such algorithms could be used to proactively reduce the sending of toxic content. We found contextual factors such as platform culture and affordances, and scales of abuse, impacting on perceptions of toxicity and effectiveness of the system. We identify different types of end-users across a continuum of intention to send toxic messages, from unaware users, to those that are determined and organised. Finally, we highlight the potential for certain end-user groups to misuse these systems to validate their attacks, to gamify hate, and to manipulate algorithmic models to exacerbate harm.}

Additionally, an attention mechanism selectively emphasizes contextually significant words, enhancing interpretability and classification accuracy. Key contributions: •Graph-based sentiment modelling to capture deep semantic relationships in text.•Improved interpretability through attention-weighted word importance.•Scalability for large social media datasets, ensuring efficient processing. Through extensive comparative experiments, our model achieves 78.64% and 92.38% accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of GNNs in large-scale emotion classification. This research underscores the transformative potential of graph-based NLP models for decoding emotional tones in social media, paving the way for more accurate and insightful sentiment analysis.

Sentiment analysis poses a challenging fine-grained task. Two typical subtasks are involved: Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) and Aspect Polarity Classification (APC). These two subtasks are usually trained discretely, which ignores the connection between ATE and APC. Concretely, we can relate ATE to APC through aspects and train them concurrently. We mainly use the ATE task as an auxiliary task, allowing the APC to focus more on relevant aspects to facilitate aspect polarity classification. In addition, previous studies have shown that utilizing dependency syntax information with a graph neural network (GNN) also contributes to the performance of the APC task. However, most studies directly input sentence dependency relations into graph neural networks without considering the influence of aspects, which do not emphasize the important dependency relationships. To address these issues, we propose a multitask learning model combining APC and ATE tasks that can extract aspect terms as well as classify aspect polarity simultaneously. Moreover, we exploit multihead attention(MHA) to associate dependency sequences with aspect extraction, which not only combines both ATE and APC tasks but also stresses the significant dependency relations, enabling the model to focus more on words closely related to aspects. According to our experiments on three benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the connection between ATE and APC can be better established by our model, which enhances aspect polarity classification performance significantly.

Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to classify the sentiment polarity of a given aspect in a sentence or document, which is a fine-grained task of natural language processing. Recent ABSA methods mainly focus on exploiting the syntactic information, the semantic information and both. Research on cognition theory reveals that the syntax an*/874d the semantics have effects on each other. In this work, a graph convolutional network-based model that fuses the syntactic information and semantic information in line with the cognitive practice is proposed. To start with, the GCN is taken to extract syntactic information on the syntax dependency tree. Then, the semantic graph is constructed via a multi-head self-attention mechanism and encoded by GCN. Furthermore, a parameter-sharing GCN is developed to capture the common information between the semantics and the syntax. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets (Laptop14, Restaurant14 and Twitter) validate that the proposed model achieves compelling performance comparing with the state-of-the-art models.}

As a prelude, we contrast failure found in case studies from the commercial sphere (Facebook's use of machine intelligence to find and categorize “hate speech”) and, later, with a brief comparison of the Department of Energy's (DOE) military nuclear waste management primarily engaged in reducing information about its own self-created risks to the public, its employees, and the environment; e.g., unaware of the risks posed to the environment and to health, the public never questioned DOE's use of cardboard boxes to dispose of the majority of its solid radioactive wastes in open landfills, exposed to open environments for months at a time. We consider how to improve the determination of risk and the exploitation of risk perception in general and for autonomous human-machine systems in particular. Generalizing our model, by discounting current social science practices, we report on a major discovery about the costs of suppressing risk perceptions. Regarding risks posed by autonomous systems, we conclude that determinations of risks need to be bounded or limited in scope as much as is feasible, an important restriction; and, to counter suppression of information about the risky choices taken by the military, businesses, or politicians, a process of open and free debate needs to be adopted by autonomous systems to challenge the risk perceptions that arise in every situation facing uncertainty or conflict.}

Too many countries still have poor data or get it too late, while the data that exist fail to cover some issues in sufficient detail. Google data can help decision-makers overcome the data shortage and completeness problems they face working with traditional sources of waste management data. The research uses publicly accessible global and country-level traditional and Google data, as well as a 988-keyword waste management dictionary. We are developing 988 WASTENN neural networks and 988 WASTERE linear regression models to estimate the use of sustainable waste management (SWAM) keywords globally. The models can be used to predict SWAM trends in efforts to minimize waste. Our tools’ main advantage is mining accessible stakeholders’ opinions of ’big data’. On average, the developed WASTERE and WASTENN models have sufficient reliability (R2aver = 0. 636–0.991). The SWAM map and models of the world developed in this study analyze the links between SWAM and its macro-environment to provide evidence-based digital recommendations and interventions that will help to improve SWAM. We analyzed 85 countries, and our findings, based on this neural networks, statistical and multi-criteria analysis, suggest that a state’s sustainability, productivity, context, and waste management performance are interconnected: as the social, environmental, political/governance, cultural, and economic (SEPCE) indicators of a country improve, its waste metrics also improve and there is more analysis of waste questions. The article proposes evidence-based policy recommendations for SEPCE incentives.}

To detect the sentiment polarity in a context given an aspect, both ACSA and ATSA highly rely on aspect-centroid sentiment information. However, aspect terms in ATSA appear in the context, but aspect categories in ACSA may not. This make it difficult to use important aspect position information and further design effective aspect injection strategy when modeling ACSA and ATSA in a unified framework. To address this problem, we propose a novel Unified Position-aware Convolutional Neural Network (UP-CNN). There are two major modifications in UP-CNN. Firstly, to handle the absence of aspect position in ACSA, we propose an aspect detection network with prior knowledge. Thus ABSA can be solved in a unified view with the important aspect position. Secondly, to fit CNN in ABSA, an aspect mask is proposed to construct aspect-aware context representation. Experimental results on seven datasets demonstrate that our model performs effectively and efficiently on both ACSA and ATSA tasks.}

Several existing articles demonstrated promising ABSA accuracy using positional embedding to show the relationship between an aspect word and its context. In most cases, the positional embedding depends on the distance between the aspect word and the remaining words in the context, known as the position index sequence. However, these techniques usually employ both complex preprocessing approaches with additional trainable positional embedding and complex architectures to obtain the state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we simplify preprocessing by including polarity lexicon replacement and masking techniques that carry the information of the aspect word’s position and eliminate the positional embedding. We then adopt a novel and concise architecture using two Bidirectional GRU along with an attention layer to classify the aspect based on its context words. Experiment results show that the simplified preprocessing and the concise architecture significantly improve the accuracy of the publicly available ABSA datasets, obtaining 81.37%, 75.39%, 80.88%, and 89.30% in restaurant 14, laptop 14, restaurant 15, and restaurant 16 respectively.}

We have examined the performance of vanilla BERT-based models and their code-mixed HingBERT counterparts on respective benchmark datasets, comparing their results with and without using word-level language information. The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our findings show that the proposed language augmentation approaches work well across different BERT models.

Physician-rating sites have become a convenient platform for patients to choose doctors. However, selecting an appropriate doctor through numerous online reviews is challengeable for patients. Although studies show that patients have different preferences for the aspects of healthcare services, existing doctor ranking methods rarely consider such preference information. Besides, they seldom handle the neutral sentiment information in patient reviews.
Methods:
To better assist patients in doctor selection, we propose a novel decision-making method that combines aspect-based sentiment analysis, single-valued neutrosophic sets and an extended Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. The method utilizes Word2Vec to construct a feature dictionary of patient satisfaction. A rule-based approach is employed to extract the aspects and the related sentiments from patients’ text reviews. Moreover, it takes advantage of single-valued neutrosophic sets to address the positive, neutral and negative sentiment information. On this basis, we rank the doctors with an extended TOPSIS method considering the patient’s attitudinal character and the preference information.
Results:
A case study on a review dataset demonstrates the stability and flexibility of the method. The comparative analysis reveals that our method can efficiently reduce information loss and it is more practical than existing methods.
Conclusion:
Considering patients’ different preferences for the aspects of healthcare services, the method can better provide healthcare decision support for patients.}

The method aims to enhance the detection of stance where misinformation can polarize user opinions. Stance detection has emerged as a crucial approach to effectively analyze underlying biases in shared information and combating misinformation. This paper proposes a novel method for Stance Prediction through a Label-fused dual cross-Attentive Emotion-aware neural Network (SPLAENet) in misinformative social media user-generated content. The proposed method employs a dual cross-attention mechanism and a hierarchical attention network to capture inter and intra-relationships by focusing on the relevant parts of source text in the context of reply text and vice versa. We incorporate emotions to effectively distinguish between different stance categories by leveraging the emotional alignment or divergence between texts. We also employ label fusion that uses distance-metric learning to align extracted features with stance labels, improving the method’s ability to accurately distinguish between stances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by SPLAENet over existing state-of-the-art methods. SPLAENet demonstrates an average gain of 8.92% in accuracy and 17.36% in F1-score on the RumourEval dataset. On the SemEval dataset, it achieves average gains of 7.02% in accuracy and 10.92% in F1-score. On the P-stance dataset, it demonstrates average gains of 10.03% in accuracy and 11.18% in F1-score. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for stance detection in the context of misinformative social media content.

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task, which needs to detection the sentiment polarity towards a given aspect. Recently, graph neural models over the dependency tree are widely applied for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Most existing works, however, they generally focus on learning the dependency information from contextual words to aspect words based on the dependency tree of the sentence, which lacks the exploitation of contextual affective knowledge with regard to the specific aspect. In this paper, we propose a graph convolutional network based on SenticNet to leverage the affective dependencies of the sentence according to the specific aspect, called Sentic GCN. To be specific, we explore a novel solution to construct the graph neural networks via integrating the affective knowledge from SenticNet to enhance the dependency graphs of sentences. Based on it, both the dependencies of contextual words and aspect words and the affective information between opinion words and the aspect are considered by the novel affective enhanced graph model. Experimental results on multiple public benchmark datasets illustrate that our proposed model can beat state-of-the-art methods.}

abstract = {Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is used to detect corresponding sentiment polarities toward different aspect terms. In recent years, graph convolutional network-based methods achieve great success for ABSA. However, previous studies ignore syntactic dependency types and aspect-related syntactic distances. Besides, effectively fusing semantic and syntactic information remains a challenging problem. Previous studies also neglect interactions between aspect terms and context. To alleviate the above problems, we develop a Multi-Information Fusion and Interaction Neural Network (MIFINN), which consists of an Aspect and Syntax-Aware Multi-Information Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (ASAMIFGCN) and a Multi-Information Interaction and Gating Network (MIIGN). The ASAMIFGCN model can integrate and fuse contextual semantics, syntactic dependency types, and aspect-related syntactic distances. Specifically, two different attentions are designed to learn global and aspect-related semantic and syntactic information, respectively. A syntactic distance gating module is proposed to acquire more precise score matrices. Besides, we propose a semantic and syntactic association module to fuse multi-information simultaneously. The MIIGN model can effectively interact aspect terms and context. Specifically, two interactive attentions are developed to learn different weights toward aspect terms and context via interactions between each other, respectively. Moreover, we propose a gating information module for controlling the information flow of aspect terms and context. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets and MIFINN achieves state-of-the-art performance. The results also demonstrate that effectively fusing and interacting multi-information can improve model performance for ABSA significantly.}

Previous studies have focused on extracting aspect-sentiment polarity pairs based on dependency trees, ignoring edge labels and phrase information. In this paper, we instead propose a phrase dependency graph attention network (PD-RGAT) on the ABSA task, which is a relational graph attention network constructed based on the phrase dependency graph, aggregating directed dependency edges and phrase information. We perform experiments with two pre-training models, GloVe and BERT. Experimental results on the benchmarking datasets (i.e., Twitter, Restaurant, and Laptop) demonstrate that our proposed PD-RGAT has comparable effectiveness to a range of state-of-the-art models and further illustrate that the graph convolutional structure based on the phrase dependency graph can capture both syntactic information and short long-range word dependencies. It also shows that incorporating directed edge labels and phrase information can enhance the capture of aspect-sentiment polarities on the ABSA task.}

Our approach first employs zero-shot prompting to extract first-order logic (FOL) rules representing each LLM’s prediction rationale, then constructs a Logical Fusion Schema (LFS) to bridge different LLMs’ knowledge representations. We further develop a Multi-view Hypergraph Convolutional Network (MvHGCN) that effectively models and encodes the integrated logical knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LogiMDF significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in stance detection tasks.

This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal representations, especially when these representations are obtained through explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities. To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities, reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomodal Attention (HIMA) to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

Next came textual data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, splitting, feature extraction, model development and assessment Amharic OCRs were employed to extract textual data. Character normalization, stop word removal, and unnecessary character removal make up the text-preprocessing step. Using Stratified KFold the textual dataset is split into the train set (80 %), the validation set (10 %) and the test set (10 %). Vectors are created from the preprocessed texts using the Bog of words (BOW), TFIDF and word embeddings. Following that, the vectors are fed into Machine learning algorithms: NB, DT, RF, KNN, LSVM and LR, and deep learning models that are based on Dense, BiGRU, and BiLSTM algorithms.

However, it has also heightened concerns about digital safety, particularly for children and adolescents who are increasingly exposed to online grooming crimes. Early and accurate identification of grooming conversations is crucial in preventing long-term harm to victims. However, research on grooming detection in South Korea remains limited, as existing models trained primarily on English text and fail to reflect the unique linguistic features of SNS conversations, leading to inaccurate classifications. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel framework that integrates optical character recognition (OCR) technology with KcELECTRA, a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) model that shows excellent performance in processing the colloquial Korean language. In the proposed framework, the KcELECTRA model is fine-tuned by an extensive dataset, including Korean social media conversations, Korean ethical verification data from AI-Hub, and Korean hate speech data from HuggingFace, to enable more accurate classification of text extracted from social media conversation images. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 0.953, outperforming existing transformer-based models. Furthermore, OCR technology shows high accuracy in extracting text from images, demonstrating that the proposed framework is effective for online grooming detection. The proposed framework is expected to contribute to the more accurate detection of grooming text and the prevention of grooming-related crimes.}

This highlights the need for effective approaches to address spelling issues in such language-based applications. This research work suggests a novel approach for identifying word-level spelling errors in Assamese text. The approach employs two deep learning techniques, Long-short-term memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long-short-term memory (BiLSTM), to accurately detect misspelled words by analyzing the context of each word inside a sentence. The models are trained using a dataset of 2677 Assamese sentences that include both correctly and incorrectly spelled words. The LSTM and Bi-LSTM models have shown significant improvement over previous spelling detection research in Assamese. LSTM achieved an accuracy of 92.72%, while Bi-LSTM achieved 94.59% accuracy. These results highlight the efficacy of deep learning methods in identifying spelling errors in the Assamese language. By ensuring precise spelling detection and reducing misunderstandings caused by misspelled words, the proposed approach can be implemented to improve the reliability of NLP tasks such as identifying toxic comments and hate speech.}

abstract = {The growth of digital and social media has led to an exponential increase in the availability of music and its lyrics. It has been observed that objectionable content is becoming a huge problem in the age of the digital era. This research aims to develop a system for automatically detecting lyrics that may contain offensive or controversial themes, such as hate speech, sexism, racism, and violence, by generating labeled data using weak supervision. In this study, we generated labels using heuristic rules using the Snorkel framework, and the performance of various machine learning classifiers, namely, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine, were evaluated on label-generated data. The results show that DistilBert performs better than frequency-based methods (TF-IDF and CountVectorizer) by 3-5% in F1 score, and the results are even more impressive on SMOTE augmented dataset, where Logistic Regression and SVM on Distilbert vectorized data performed similarly and has exhibited 6-8% of F1 score gain over frequency based methods. In addition, it asserts that the proposed method can be used to detect offensive lyrics in other languages, given the same type of data used in this study. Our work will help music industry professionals and digital content monitoring systems for hate and offensive content to adopt the methodology and approaches used in our work.}

Therefore, we propose a permutation based XLNet fine-tuning model for aspect category detection and sentiment polarity detection. Our model learns bidirectional contexts via positional encoding and factorization order. We evaluate the proposed permutation language model on three ABSA datasets, namely, SentiHood, SemEval 2015, and SemEval 2016.

In this work, we propose a knowledge-enabled language representation model BERT for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Specifically, our proposal leverages the additional information from a sentiment knowledge graph by injecting sentiment domain knowledge into the language representation model, which obtains the embedding vectors of entities in the sentiment knowledge graph and words in the text in a consistent vector space. In addition, the model is capable of achieving better performance with a small amount of training data by incorporating external domain knowledge into the language representation model to compensate for the limited training data. As a result, our model is able to provide explainable and detailed results for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that the knowledge-enabled BERT is an excellent choice for solving aspect-based sentiment analysis problems.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained process. Its fundamental subtasks are aspect term extraction (ATE) and aspect polarity classification (APC), and these subtasks are dependent and closely related. However, most existing works on Arabic ABSA content separately address them, assume that aspect terms are preidentified, or use a pipeline model. Pipeline solutions design different models for each task, and the output from the ATE model is used as the input to the APC model, which may result in error propagation among different steps because APC is affected by ATE error. These methods are impractical for real-world scenarios where the ATE task is the base task for APC, and its result impacts the accuracy of APC. Thus, in this study, we focused on a multi-task learning model for Arabic ATE and APC in which the model is jointly trained on two subtasks simultaneously in a single model. This paper integrates the multi-task model, namely Local Cotext Foucse-Aspect Term Extraction and Polarity classification (LCF-ATEPC) and Arabic Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (AraBERT) as a shred layer for Arabic contextual text representation. The LCF-ATEPC model is based on a multi-head self-attention and local context focus mechanism (LCF) to capture the interactive information between an aspect and its context. Moreover, data augmentation techniques are proposed based on state-of-the-art augmentation techniques (word embedding substitution with constraints and contextual embedding (AraBERT)) to increase the diversity of the training dataset. This paper examined the effect of data augmentation on the multi-task model for Arabic ABSA. Extensive experiments were conducted on the original and combined datasets (merging the original and augmented datasets). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Multi-task model outperformed existing APC techniques. Superior results were obtained by AraBERT and LCF-ATEPC with fusion layer (AR-LCF-ATEPC-Fusion) and the proposed data augmentation word embedding-based method (FastText) on the combined dataset.}

Hate speech from anonymous users can result in psychological harm, including depression and trauma, and can even lead to suicide. Malicious online comments are increasingly becoming a social and cultural problem. It is therefore critical to detect such comments at the national level and detect malicious users at the corporate level. To achieve a healthy and safe Internet environment, studies should focus on institutional and technical topics. The detection of toxic comments can create a safe online environment. In this study, to detect malicious comments, we used approximately 9,400 examples of hate speech from a Korean corpus of entertainment news comments. We developed toxic comment classification models using supervised learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forest, a support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbors. The proposed model uses random forests to classify toxic words, achieving an F1-score of 0.94. We analyzed the trained model using the permutation feature importance, which is an explanatory machine learning method. Our experimental results confirmed that the toxic comment classifier properly classified hate words used in Korea. Using this research methodology, the proposed method can create a healthy Internet environment by detecting malicious comments written in Korean.}

Since a sentence often contains several sentiments for different aspects, it is very important to capture the correspondences between aspects and opinion words in a sentence. To this end, we propose an aspect opinion interactive attention routing network model, which adopts an interactive attention mechanism between specific aspect embeddings learned from graph convolutional network and opinion semantic embeddings learned from three bi-directional long short-term memory networks. Furthermore, dynamic routing is applied to the neural network so that its output values are constantly regulated during training to generate feature representations of specific aspects related to opinion word. Based on the above, our approach identifies opinion words feature information related to specific aspect words in context. Experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms 16 existing methods in terms of accuracy and macro-average F1 score on most of the benchmark datasets.}

abstract = {With the proliferation of user-generated content on the web, sentiment analysis of text has become a current research hotspot. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a type of fine-grained sentiment analysis that aims to identify the sentiment polarities of an aspect given in a context sentence. To date, most ABSA methods are based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and attention mechanism. However, RNNs suffer from losing long-distance dependency as the sentence length increases. In contrast, self-attention (SA) concentrates on extracting the dependencies among words regardless of the distance. However, similar to RNNs, SA is not sensitive enough to perceive the local semantics information for the ABSA task. In addition, the attention mechanism employed in ABSA may introduce some noise, which is not conducive to capturing important sentiment expressions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a semantics perception and refinement network (SPRN) for sentiment analysis based on aspects. In the SPRN, a novel structure named the dual gated multichannel convolution (DGMCC) is utilized to acquire the aspect-related semantics features of a sentence. Specifically, based on the sentence’s global dependency obtained by the SA-based mechanism as the context information and aspect information over the sentence, a multichannel convolution (MCC) is designed with multiple semantic spaces to extract informative local semantic features. Moreover, a dual refinement gate (DRG) is proposed to strengthen the interaction between the aspect and context at a fine granularity and enhance the noise filter. To verify the effect of the SPRN, we conduct abundant experiments on 5 benchmark datasets with pretrained BERT and GloVe embeddings. The experimental results demonstrate that the SPRN performs better than 14 state-of-the-art ABSA methods in terms of various evaluation indices such as accuracy, marco-F1 and AUROC.}

abstract = {In esports and online gaming, toxicity represents a significant challenge that stems from negative behaviours, including harassment, hate speech, and bullying. Although prior research has documented its prevalence, not much is known about how young esports players experience and navigate these issues, particularly in educational contexts. This study examines how Norwegian high school students in an elite esports programme perceived, experienced, and managed toxicity. A reflexive thematic analysis of interviews with 12 students (9 male, 3 female) and follow-up interviews with 10 students (7 male, 3 female) revealed experiences of both performance- and identity-based toxicity. While male students primarily faced performance-based toxicity, female students encountered gendered harassment. Male peers condemned this gendered harassment but emphasised the severity of their own experiences. Beyond gender, players noted that skill level influenced the frequency and type of toxicity, with mid-tier ranks experiencing it more than those in lower or higher tiers. Although toxicity was prevalent, students rejected the victimhood mentality. They employed various coping strategies—ranging from social, technical, pedagogical, in-game, and psychological approaches—thereby demonstrating resilience and a commitment to fostering inclusive esports communities. This study reveals how educational environments shape coping strategies and awareness of toxicity. It emphasises the necessity for inclusive, gender-sensitive approaches in esports governance and mental health initiatives to tackle performance-related toxicity and gender exclusion. Future research should explore how educational interventions extend beyond schools and how skill level and intersectional factors—such as ethnicity, sexuality, and socioeconomic background—interact with gender to influence toxicity in esports.}

Innovative approaches include the use of topic-grouped attention and adversarial learning for zero-shot detection, as well as fine-tuning techniques that enhance model robustness. Additionally, prompt-tuning methods and the integration of external knowledge have further refined model performance.

These datasets are well-labelled but may not have the same distribution as real-world data and consequently fail to reflect the real world. Furthermore, stock market emotion is reflected not only in textual comments but also in images; emotion recognition on the basis of textual comments alone is one-sided. Considering these issues, in this paper, we propose a multimodal emotion recognition framework that is trained via imitation learning from a large language model. The proposed framework contains two main innovations. First, by leveraging large language model's compositionality capability, the proposed framework generates pseudo labels from textual comments. Through imitating the patterns of the pseudo labels, the framework can be trained directly on unlabelled real-world data, which addresses current models' distribution drift between public datasets and the real-world. Second, multimodal fusion is equipped with the proposed framework, enabling emotion recognition from textual stock market comments and images simultaneously. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method in this paper significantly improves the performance of stock market emotion recognition by leveraging large language models and multimodal stock market data. The experimental results demonstrate that the emotion recognition framework proposed in this paper outperforms the existing single-mode models and multimodal models, with the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score being 82.97 %, 83.03 %, 83.05 %, and 82.88 % respectively. This framework provides a new pathway for multimodal and unsupervised/semi-supervised emotion recognition in the stock market.}

It involves assuming sentiments from the subjective text. To comprehend customer satisfaction, trends, experience, opinion, and influence, a huge collection of data collected by businesses, medical sectors, e-commerce, engineering, and academia is analyzed. SA involves data collection, data preprocessing, sentiment detection, sentiment classification, and output detection. Sentence-based SA, aspect-based SA, and document-based SA are some of the several types of SA. The entire document is taken into account for analysis in document-based SA. Positive or negative connotations are assigned to the entire document. Every sentence is taken and examined in sentence-based analysis to categorize it as positive or negative. However, neither of these two analyses offers a precise classification. However, aspect-based SA entails extracting aspects from sentences, identifying opinions, and classifying aspects at the aspect level. The various machine learning and deep learning methods for aspect-based SA are reviewed in this chapter. It also discusses the datasets that are frequently utilized in the literature for SA. Additionally, it combines the comparative analysis of all the methodologies and sheds light on the areas of aspect-based SA where research is still lacking.}

Considering the practical application, researchers use more joint methods rather than pipeline methods. However, existing joint methods cannot model the interaction between aspect-terms and the sentence they belong to, or consider the relevance among the sentiments of different aspect-terms. In this paper, a novel end-to-end generative model based on encoder-decoder, namely Joint Term-Sentiment Generator (JTSG), is presented to generate all aspect term-polarity pairs. Specifically, a pre-trained model based encoder is used to encode the sentences, and specially, the decoder generates the start and end position to determine an aspect-term, rather than generate aspect-terms themselves. This new generative method contributes to avoid generating incomplete aspect-terms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields competitive performance on three benchmark datasets.}

We evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC.

abstract = {The widespread proliferation of religiously aggressive contents on social media platforms poses significant threats to societal harmony and communal solidarity. It often incites religious animosity, provokes violence and disseminates life-threatening messages that intensifies societal divisions and undermines social harmony. Despite significant advancements in identifying such contents in high-resource languages like English, there exists a notable scarcity of resources for regional languages like Bengali which constrains the development of effective detection and prevention tools. To address this gap, we introduce ALERT (Analysis of Linguistic Extremism in Religious Texts), a newly developed Bengali dataset along with English translation which includes 4,027 annotated instances classified into four categories: hate speech (995), vandalism (909), atrocity (1,117), and no aggression (1,006). The dataset was sourced from many online platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, online news websites, blogs and group chats. Each of the instances in the dataset was annotated by any two annotators from the list of four having diverse religious, ethnic, geographical, and academic backgrounds. Any conflicts or disagreements between annotators during the annotation process were resolved through consultation with a domain expert. The preprocessing stages include the elimination of English words, duplication and alphanumeric characters to ensure data integrity. The dataset attains a Cohen’s kappa score of 72% that signifies a strong inter-annotator agreement and a Jaccard similarity score between 16% and 23% which reflects the degree of overlap between classes. Moreover, Experiments with various machine learning, deep learning and transformer-based models yield promising results. ALERT serves as a benchmark dataset for religiously aggressive text classification that may contribute to the advancement of research in this field. The dataset is publicly accessible for research purposes to promote innovation and collaboration within the Bengali NLP community.}

abstract = {Background
Mixed reality (MR) devices provide real-time environments for physical-digital interactions across many domains. Owing to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, MR technologies have supported many new use cases in the health care industry, enabling social distancing practices to minimize the risk of contact and transmission. Despite their novelty and increasing popularity, public evaluations are sparse and often rely on social interactions among users, developers, researchers, and potential buyers.
Objective
The purpose of this study is to use aspect-based sentiment analysis to explore changes in sentiment during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as new use cases emerged in the health care industry; to characterize net insights for MR developers, researchers, and users; and to analyze the features of HoloLens 2 (Microsoft Corporation) that are helpful for certain fields and purposes.
Methods
To investigate the user sentiment, we collected 8492 tweets on a wearable MR headset, HoloLens 2, during the initial 10 months since its release in late 2019, coinciding with the onset of the pandemic. Human annotators rated the individual tweets as positive, negative, neutral, or inconclusive. Furthermore, by hiring an interannotator to ensure agreements between the annotators, we used various word vector representations to measure the impact of specific words on sentiment ratings. Following the sentiment classification for each tweet, we trained a model for sentiment analysis via supervised learning.
Results
The results of our sentiment analysis showed that the bag-of-words tokenizing method using a random forest supervised learning approach produced the highest accuracy of the test set at 81.29%. Furthermore, the results showed an apparent change in sentiment during the COVID-19 pandemic period. During the onset of the pandemic, consumer goods were severely affected, which aligns with a drop in both positive and negative sentiment. Following this, there is a sudden spike in positive sentiment, hypothesized to be caused by the new use cases of the device in health care education and training. This pandemic also aligns with drastic changes in the increased number of practical insights for MR developers, researchers, and users and positive net sentiments toward the HoloLens 2 characteristics.
Conclusions
Our approach suggests a simple yet effective way to survey public opinion about new hardware devices quickly. The findings of this study contribute to a holistic understanding of public perception and acceptance of MR technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight several new implementations of HoloLens 2 in health care. We hope that these findings will inspire new use cases and technological features.}

Additionally, despite the growing interest in personalized Natural Language Processing, recent studies have highlighted limitations in the literature, particularly the lack of explainability methods to interpret the improvements observed in these models. This study explores the CLARIN-Emo dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating personalized and contextual information for accurate emotion detection. By framing textual emotion recognition as a sequence sentence classification (SSC) task and leveraging transformer-based architectures, the proposed multi-source fusion approach significantly outperformed the baseline model, which considers each sentence in isolation. Furthermore, a personalized method, referred to as UserID, captures user-specific characteristics by assigning each annotator a unique identifier, significantly enhancing emotion prediction accuracy. This work also introduces an extension of Data Maps by differentiating dynamic training metrics to analyze the models’ training behaviors. The results validate the capability of this approach in visually interpreting and facilitating performance comparisons between models.}

abstract = {Background
The development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines have generated optimism for the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and a return to normalcy. However, vaccine hesitancy, often fueled by misinformation, poses a major barrier to achieving herd immunity.
Objective
We aim to investigate Twitter users’ attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination in Canada after vaccine rollout.
Methods
We applied a weakly supervised aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) technique, which involves the human-in-the-loop system, on COVID-19 vaccination–related tweets in Canada. Automatically generated aspect and opinion terms were manually corrected by public health experts to ensure the accuracy of the terms and make them more domain-specific. Then, based on these manually corrected terms, the system inferred sentiments toward the aspects. We observed sentiments toward key aspects related to COVID-19 vaccination, and investigated how sentiments toward “vaccination” changed over time. In addition, we analyzed the most retweeted or liked tweets by observing most frequent nouns and sentiments toward key aspects.
Results
After applying the ABSA system, we obtained 170 aspect terms (eg, “immunity” and “pfizer”) and 6775 opinion terms (eg, “trustworthy” for the positive sentiment and “jeopardize” for the negative sentiment). While manually verifying or editing these terms, our public health experts selected 20 key aspects related to COVID-19 vaccination for analysis. The sentiment analysis results for the 20 key aspects revealed negative sentiments related to “vaccine distribution,” “side effects,” “allergy,” “reactions,” and “anti-vaxxer,” and positive sentiments related to “vaccine campaign,” “vaccine candidates,” and “immune response.” These results indicate that the Twitter users express concerns about the safety of vaccines but still consider vaccines as the option to end the pandemic. In addition, compared to the sentiment of the remaining tweets, the most retweeted or liked tweets showed more positive sentiment overall toward key aspects (P<.001), especially vaccines (P<.001) and vaccination (P=.009). Further investigation of the most retweeted or liked tweets revealed two opposing trends in Twitter users who showed negative sentiments toward vaccines: the “anti-vaxxer” population that used negative sentiments as a means to discourage vaccination and the “Covid Zero” population that used negative sentiments to encourage vaccinations while critiquing the public health response.
Conclusions
Our study examined public sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccination on tweets over an extended period in Canada. Our findings could inform public health agencies to design and implement interventions to promote vaccination.}

abstract = {Context
With comics being a multimodal composition of content, their characters typically display stylized appearance, do not make use of verbal communication, and do not provide non-verbal visual cues, their emotion recognition poses a variety of unique challenges. Currently, it has not been embracing efforts in text-based sentiment analysis or facial expression detection, nor does it consider the contextual meaning of background colors and such artistic markings.
Objective
This study proposes a comprehensive multimodal framework for increasing the accuracy and interpretability of comic-based emotion recognition by using visual, textual, and color-based features. The focus is to alleviate the drawbacks of unimodal systems and a rigorous emotion classification model.
Method
The framework uses a domain-adapted Vision Transformer (ViT) for facial expression analysis, AFINN lexicon-based sentiment analysis for dialogues, and HSV-based background color extraction. A fuzzy logic-based fusion system combines modality outputs through membership functions, rule-based reasoning, and defuzzification. The model is trained and evaluated on a custom dataset of 2,000 annotated comic panels.
Results
The proposed model achieved 93.7 % accuracy, 93.5 % Precision, 93.4 % Recall, 93.3 % F1-score, and an AUC of 0.94, with 4.5 s inference time per panel. Ablation studies show that background color analysis improved accuracy by 2.5 %, fuzzy fusion enhanced F1-score by 3.1 %, and ViT adaptation outperformed CNNs by 5.1 % in accuracy. This is the first known application of ViT in stylized comic emotion recognition, with contributions in contextual cue modeling, adaptive fusion, and explainability.}

However, traditional deep neural networks for stance detection often suffer from limitations, including the requirement for large amounts of labeled data, uninterpretability of prediction results, and difficulty in incorporating human intentions and domain knowledge. This paper introduces the First-Order Logic Aggregated Reasoning framework (FOLAR), an innovative approach that integrates first-order logic (FOL) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance the interpretability and efficacy of stance detection. FOLAR comprises three key components: a Knowledge Elicitation module that generates FOL rules using a chain-of-thought prompting method, a Logic Tensor Network (LTN) that encodes these rules for stance detection, and a Multi-Decision Fusion mechanism that aggregates LTNs’ outputs to minimize biases and improve robustness. Our experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of FOLAR, showing it as a promising solution for explainable and accurate stance detection. The source code will be made publicly available to foster further research.}

While deep learning models have improved emotion recognition solutions, it is still an active area of research. One important limitation is that most emotion recognition systems use only text as input, ignoring features such as voice intonation. Another limitation is the limited number of datasets available for multimodal emotion recognition. In addition, most published datasets contain emotions that are simulated by professionals and produce limited results in real-world scenarios. In other languages, such as Spanish, hardly any datasets are available. Therefore, our contributions to emotion recognition are as follows. First, we compile and annotate a new corpus for multimodal emotion recognition in Spanish (Spanish MEACorpus 2023), which contains 13.16 h of speech divided into 5129 segments labeled by considering Ekman’s six basic emotions. The dataset is extracted from YouTube videos in natural environments. Second, we explore several deep learning models for emotion recognition using text- and audio-based features. Third, we evaluate different multimodal techniques to build a multimodal recognition system that improves the results of unimodal models, achieving a Macro F1-score of 87.745%, using late fusion with concatenation strategy approach.}

Although much research has already been done to analyze students' opinions, the literature on professors' opinion mining is relatively scarce. This article investigates if the professors' opinions on the adoption and effectiveness of the latest teaching trends in the post-pandemic era reflect a generation gap. Combining descriptive statistics and opinion mining, a mixed-method approach is used to analyze comprehensive data from 151 professors' perspectives. The Faculty Development and Educational Innovation Center (CEDDIE) at Tecnologico de Monterrey developed and circulated the quantitative questionnaire online using convenient sampling. The results reveal that 84.1% of professors are positive about embracing technological changes in teaching-learning. Furthermore, the positive alignment of the subjectivity score based on opinion mining suggested that professors recorded their findings and experiences rather than simply stating facts in the survey. The chi-square test demonstrates a significant relationship between the generation of professors and their opinions. Regardless of their teaching generation, most professors' express openness to integrating new trends and tools into their pedagogical practices. The qualitative data further elucidates the challenges influencing professors' attitudes.}

This paper presents four approaches for customer review analysis and classification: the grade-based approach, content-based approach, content-based NRC-Emotion Lexicon approach, and collaborative approach. We employ three machine learning algorithms—stacking, random forest, and LogitBoost—to evaluate the performance of these approaches.

Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e., “Speech Concept Bottleneck Model” (SCBM), using adjectives as human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models (LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter, Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a 1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact, interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition. With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.}

However, these GCN-based methods excessively rely on the quality of the dependency-parsing tree, resulting possibly in suboptimal dependencies between words. Moreover, these GCN-based models fail to adapt properly to informal and complex comments without syntactic dependencies. To alleviate these deficiencies, we proposed a target-based GCN with semantic and syntactic information (TSGCN). In a TSGCN, a new target generation (NTG) module with a dependency attention mechanism is designed to generate a new target representation using explicit semantic information to replace a given aspect. Then, the syntactic structure is reconstructed based on the new target representation to capture the shortest distance between the given aspect and viewpoint words. Finally, the semantic structure generated by the self-attention mechanism was injected into the syntactic structure to complement the semantic dependencies between words. The experimental findings on five benchmark datasets indicated that the TSGCN outperformed the other baseline models.}

The scarcity of labeled data remains a fundamental challenge in developing robust and generalizable AI models, particularly for low-resource languages.

To address these challenges, we propose XAI-Guided Context-Aware Data Augmentation. This novel framework leverages XAI techniques to modify less critical features while selectively preserving most task-relevant features. Our approach integrates an iterative feedback loop, which refines augmented data over multiple augmentation cycles based on explainability-driven insights and the model performance gain. Our experimental results demonstrate that XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT improve the accuracy of models on hate speech and sentiment analysis tasks by 6.6 % and 8.1 %, respectively, compared to the baseline, using the Amharic dataset with the XLM-R model. XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT outperform existing augmentation techniques by 4.8 % and 5 %, respectively, on the same dataset and model. Overall, XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT consistently outperform both baseline and conventional augmentation techniques across all tasks and models. This study provides a more controlled, interpretable, and context-aware solution to data augmentation, addressing critical limitations of existing augmentation techniques and offering a new paradigm shift for leveraging XAI techniques to enhance AI model training.}

Although previous research has demonstrated that syntax knowledge can be beneficial for E2E-ABSA, standard syntax dependency parsing struggles to capture the block-level relation between aspect and opinion terms, which hinders the role of syntax in E2E-ABSA. To address this issue, this paper proposes a block-level dependency syntax parsing (BDEP) based model to enhance the performance of E2E-ABSA. BDEP is constructed by incorporating routine dependency syntax parsing and part-of-speech tagging, which enables the capture of block-level relations. Subsequently. the BDEP-guided interactive attention module (BDEP-IAM) is used to obtain the aspect-aware representation of each word. Finally the adaptive fusion module is leveraged to combine the semantic-syntactic representation to simultaneously extract the aspect term and identify aspect-orient sentiment polarity. The model is evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including Laptop14, Rest _ALL, Restaurant14, Restaurant15, and TWITTER, with F1 scores of 62.67%, 76.53%, 75.42%, 62.21%, and 58.03%, respectively.

abstract = {Recently, social media has changed the way, information is produced, transferred and consumed. User-generated content in the form of posts, blogs, comments, feedback, and reviews, has established a new connection between the producers and users of information. Tracking such content has enabled businesses to collect customer’s feedback to provide better services. The abundance of information from diverse sources helps users tap into the wisdom of crowds and aid in making more informed decisions. This raised the question of overcoming information overload and providing a rich and coherent user experience. This question has opened a rich venue for researchers on how to analyze such a huge amount of customer feedback to get actionable insights. A lot of research has been conducted in this area, which largely depends on opinion mining, sentiment analysis and text mining algorithms to interpret and make sense of large amounts of textual data. The proposed survey aims to identify application domains. Exploring each application domain to determine which one is more complex than others. Evaluating state-of-the-art NLP and machine learning techniques against application domains. Setting a future direction by deliberating the complexity of the dataset, lack of benchmark dataset, performance comparison, and future work. Moreover, this study critically analyzed surveys on document-level sentiment analysis and aspect-based sentiment analysis surveys. In this way, the last ten years' surveys (document and aspect level) have been investigated to find out what areas these surveys are not addressing. The main focus is on aspect-based sentiment analysis techniques (ABSTs). On the other hand, this study provides such a novelty by identifying limitations in machine learning techniques, the complexity of the dataset, and identifying application domains and NLP challenges. In addition, six application domains and four limitations have been identified by exploring the recent ten years of aspect-based sentiment analysis techniques. Finally, it thoroughly explores the application domains and limitations of aspect-based sentiment analysis techniques.}

abstract = {End-to-end aspect-based sentiment analysis (E2E-ABSA) is a sequence labeling task which detects aspect terms and the corresponding sentiment simultaneously. Previous works ignore the useful task-specific knowledge and embed the vital aspect and sentiment attributes implicitly in the intermediate layers. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical multi-task learning framework, which explicitly leverages task-related knowledge via the supervision of intermediate layers. Specifically, aspect term extraction, sentiment lexicon detection, and aspect sentiment detection are designed to encode the aspect boundary and sentiment information. The tasks are in charge of different perspectives and levels of knowledge, which provide multi-fold regulation effects to optimize the main task. Unlike vanilla multi-task learning, all the tasks are integrated into a hierarchical structure to help the higher-level tasks make full use of the lower-level tasks’ information. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results. Further analysis shows that the proposed method achieves better performance than single-task and vanilla multi-task learning methods and yields a more discriminative feature representation.}

Our framework: (1) shares the same pre-trained backbone network between two subtasks, ensuring the associations and commonalities between them; (2) considers the hierarchical feature of the deep neural network and introduces two joint approaches, namely the specific-layer joint model and multiple-layer joint model, coupling two specific layers or multiple task-related layers with subtasks; (3) carries out parallel execution in both training and inference processes, improving the inference throughput and al-leviating the target-polarity mismatch problem.

However, most existing methods attempt to construct dependency relations into a homogeneous dependency graph with sparsity and ambiguity, which only considers one type of node and one type of edge, thus cannot cover the comprehensive contextualized features of short texts or consider any additional node types or semantic relation information. To solve those issues, we present a sentiment analysis model, Isomer, which performs dual-channel attention on heterogeneous dependency graphs incorporating external knowledge to integrate additional information effectively. Specifically, a transfer-enhanced dual-channel heterogeneous dependency attention network is designed in Isomer for modeling short texts by heterogeneous dependency graphs. These heterogeneous dependency graphs not only consider different types of information but also incorporate external knowledge. Experiments studies show that Isomer outperforms the-state-of-arts on diverse datasets. Furthermore, the results suggest that Isomer captures the importance of various information features to focus on informative contextual words.}

abstract = {This Research presents the first-ever, high-quality, automatically annotated Kurdish stance detection dataset in the Sorani dialect to fill the gap of lacking annotated resources for Kurdish, a low-resource language in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The dataset consists of 2,174 Kurdish news articles—1,410 economic and 764 political—that were originally published in 2024 and 2025, which are recent and topically relevant. By selecting these texts from well-known Kurdish news agencies, content validity and linguistic purity were preserved throughout. Necessary preprocessing techniques are applied. Annotation is carried out in two steps. First, a pattern-recognition method with 2,456 phrases and keywords was applied to determine if the subject of every text fell into the economics or politics category. Next, the position of every article was annotated with an extended lexicon of 4,243 adjectives and verbs, categorized under support, oppose, and neutral. Wherever direct matches were not possible, semantic similarity and zero-shot classification were used as fallback measures. In order to verify the automatic annotation, a team of domain experts manually assessed a representative sample of the annotated texts, with a high inter-annotator agreement score confirming the validity of the approach. The dataset is made available in XLSX (Excel) format, facilitating ease of use and versatility for a variety of research tasks in NLP. Due to its annotated and organized corpus, this dataset is a solid starting point for researchers who are building Kurdish language processing models. The dataset is released publicly to allow other researchers to build upon it and push the limits of NLP system performance on low-resource languages.}

abstract = {Most consumers read online reviews written by different users before making purchase decisions, where each opinion expresses some sentiment. Therefore, sentiment analysis is currently a hot topic of research. In particular, aspect-based sentiment analysis concerns the exploration of emotions, opinions and facts that are expressed by people, usually in the form of polarity. It is crucial to consider polarity calculations and not simply categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. Currently, the available lexicon-based method accuracy is affected by limited coverage. Several of the available polarity estimation techniques are too general and may not reflect the aspect/topic in question if reviews contain a wide range of information about different topics. This paper presents a model for the polarity estimation of customer reviews using aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA-PER). ABSA-PER has three major phases: data preprocessing, aspect co-occurrence calculation (CAC) and polarity estimation. A multi-domain sentiment dataset, Twitter dataset, and trust pilot forum dataset (developed by us by defined judgement rules) are used to verify ABSA-PER. Experimental outcomes show that ABSA-PER achieves better accuracy, i.e., 85.7% accuracy for aspect extraction and 86.5% accuracy in terms of polarity estimation, than that of the baseline methods.}

abstract = {Emotion recognition and analysis have become increasingly important in recent years, particularly with the rapid digitization and automation of virtual agents. As these systems are integrated into various aspects of daily life, enabling them to understand and respond to human emotions is essential for creating more natural, empathetic, and effective interactions. Humanizing virtual agents through emotion-aware capabilities enhances user experience, plays a critical role in emotion-driven services, such as personalized customer support and mental health assistance, thereby offering significant socio-economic benefits. Despite the significant advancements achieved in high-resource languages within this field, these results cannot be directly generalized to low-resource languages such as Moroccan Arabic. This is because emotional expression is highly influenced by cultural, regional, and linguistic factors, leaving a gap between research on high- and low-resource languages. One of the major challenges hindering the development of such a powered system is the lack of a high-quality and realistic dataset. This paper introduces MDER-MA, a comprehensive multimodal dataset designed for emotion recognition in the Moroccan Arabic dialect. Contains 5288 data items that express one of the four emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, and Neutral, expressed in four different modalities: audio, text, spectrogram, and Mel-spectrogram images. Each modality contains 1322 samples. The samples were collected from various regions across Morocco to ensure the creation of a representative dataset that is not biased toward any single geographic or linguistic area. MDER-MA supports multiple applications, including emotion recognition, audio transcription, age and gender identification from both speech, text, and image modalities. Annotation was conducted by five native Moroccan speakers, ensuring high linguistic reliability for real-time emotion recognition tasks. This work aims to bridge the gap between high-resource and low-resource languages in the field of emotion-aware and humanized intelligent systems, and to foster the development of Arabic language technologies, with particular attention to regional dialects such as Moroccan Arabic.}

Specific aspects were grounded in the Unified Medical Language System, a large repository of inter-related biomedical concepts and the corresponding terminology. Our experiments demonstrated that graph convolution approach outperforms standard deep learning architectures on the task of aspect-based sentiment analysis. Moreover, graph convolution over dependency parse trees (F-score of 0.8179) outperforms the same approach over a flat sequence representation of sentences (F-score of 0.7332). These results bring the performance of sentiment analysis in health and well-being in line with the state of the art in other domains.}

This level of analysis is the most detailed version that is capable of exploring the nuanced viewpoints of the reviews. The bulk of study in ABSA focuses on English with very little work available in Arabic. Most previous work in Arabic has been based on regular methods of machine learning that mainly depends on a group of rare resources and tools for analyzing and processing Arabic content such as lexicons, but the lack of those resources presents another challenge. In order to address these challenges, Deep Learning (DL)-based methods are proposed using two models based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) neural networks for ABSA. The first is a DL model that takes advantage of word and character representations by combining bidirectional GRU, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Conditional Random Field (CRF) making up the (BGRU-CNN-CRF) model to extract the main opinionated aspects (OTE). The second is an interactive attention network based on bidirectional GRU (IAN-BGRU) to identify sentiment polarity toward extracted aspects. We evaluated our models using the benchmarked Arabic hotel reviews dataset. The results indicate that the proposed methods are better than baseline research on both tasks having 39.7% enhancement in F1-score for opinion target extraction (T2) and 7.58% in accuracy for aspect-based sentiment polarity classification (T3). Achieving F1 score of 70.67% for T2, and accuracy of 83.98% for T3.}

An object emotion-modeling mapping module is proposed to analyze the effect of objects and object combinations with emotion information on image sentiment; this module maps common objects to emotion dimensions and improves image sentiment classification with abundant object combination information.

Incorporating attention mechanism allows the model to concentrate on important words that strongly convey sentiment and emotion. We compare three baseline models, and our findings show that BERTweet outperforms the standard BERT model and exhibits similar performance to RoBERTa in crisis tweets. Furthermore, we employ natural language processing techniques to extract key subject entities (e.g., police, victims) and leverage the publicly available commonsense knowledge model, COMET-ATOMIC 2020, to identify their intentions in given crisis scenarios. Evaluation of COMET-ATOMIC 2020 on subject-based intent prediction in crisis tweets reveals that BART was superior to GPT2-XL model, providing crisis responders with vital information for better decision making.

The main task of aspect-based sentiment analysis is to determine the sentiment polarity of a given aspect in the sentence. A major issue lies in identifying the aspect sentiment is to establish the relationship between the aspect and its opinion words. The application of syntactic dependency trees is one such resolution. However, the widely-used dependency parsers still have challenges in obtaining a solid sentiment classification result. In this work, an information propagation graph convolutional network based on syntactic structure optimization is proposed on the task of ABSA. To further complement the syntactic information, the semantic information is incorporated to learn the representations using graph information propagation mechanism. In addition, the effects of syntactic and semantic information are adapted via feature separation. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed model achieves satisfying performance against the state-of-the-art methods, indicating that the model can precisely build the relation between aspect and its context words.}

Results indicate that in the US midterm elections 2022, Arizona was the state that provided more content (507,551 tweets) related to a Chief Electoral Official, with 31.58% of them identified in the most aggressive cluster due to its mean attribute values of “attack on commenter” (0.7), “inflammatory” (∼0.3), “attack on author” (∼0.2), and “toxicity” (∼0.2). The name entity recognition model also identified an association between those aggressive tweets and the previous 2020 US Presidential campaign, characterized by attacks on election officials based on conspiracy theories campaigns. Knowledge graphs contributed to understanding the concentration of attacks and connectivity between topics commonly mentioned in hate speech content.

However, most existing graph network-based models only consider the syntactic dependencies between specific aspects and contexts. These cannot capture the internal semantic correlations within aspect-specific phrases and ignore the sentiment interaction relations between different aspects of a sentence. In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolutional network with sentiment interaction and multi-graph perception for aspect-based sentiment analysis. The proposed model considers the complementarity of semantic dependencies and sentiment interactions simultaneously. Specifically, we generate four types of adjacency graphs by integrating the internal semantic correlations between aspect phrases and linking the sentiment interaction relations among different aspects. Adjacency graphs are used to construct graph convolutional neural networks to enrich aspect-centric dependencies and enhance the capability of context-awareness. In addition, we construct a multi-graph perception mechanism to capture the specific dependency information that cannot be captured between different graphs and hence reduce the amount of overlapping information. Experimental results on five publicly-available datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves the best performance in terms of accuracy and macro-F1 score.}

abstract = {Fine-grained aspect-based sentiment analysis requires language models to identify aspect entities and the corresponding sentiment information in the input text content. Transformer-based pre-trained large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on various challenging natural language processing tasks. However, large language models face limitations in explicitly modelling syntactic relationships and effectively capturing local nuances between terms in the text content, which constrains their capability in fine-grained aspect-based sentiment analysis. We propose a novel span and syntax enhanced joint learning framework based on the latest large language model. The framework incorporates three key components, including the span-aware attention mechanism, the contextual Transformer, and the syntax-aware Transformer, which examine in parallel to generate span-aware features, contextual features, and syntax-aware features, respectively. The three dimensions of analyzed features are dynamically fused in the feature aggregation module, resulting in a combined feature for aspect entity recognition and sentiment classification. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the pioneering effort to comprehensively leverage span-aware, contextual, and syntax-aware characteristics to augment large language models in addressing the fine-grained aspect-based sentiment analysis task. Experimental results on publicly available benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the architecture compared to state-of-the-art baseline competitors.}

abstract = {The goal of aspect-based sentiment classification (ASC) is to predict the corresponding emotion of a specific target of a sentence. In neural network-based methods for ASC, various sophisticated models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widespread. Recently, ongoing research has integrated syntactic structures into graph neural networks (GNN) to deal with ASC tasks. However, these methods are limited due to the noise and inefficient use of information of syntactic dependency trees. This paper proposes a novel GNN based deep learning model to overcome the deficiencies of prior studies. In the proposed model, to exploit the information in the syntactic dependency trees, a novel part-of-speech (POS) guided syntactic dependency graph is constructed for a relational graph attention network (RGAT) to eliminate the noises. Further, a syntactic distance attention-guided layer is designed for a densely connected graph convolutional network (DCGCN), which can fully extract semantic dependency between contextual words. Experiments on three public datasets are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Comparing to the baselines, our model, as a best alternative, achieves state-of-arts performance.}

This paper introduces “MuSe-CarASTE”, an extensive and meticulously curated dataset purpose-built to propel ASTE advancements within the automotive domain. The core emphasis of MuSe-CarASTE is on aspect, opinion, and sentiment triplets, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of product reviews. Comprising transcripts from MuSe-Car’s automotive video reviews, MuSe-CarASTE presents a sub-stantial collection of nearly 28,295 sentences organized into 5,500 segments. Each segment is meticulously annotated with multiple aspects, opinions, and sentiment labels, offering unprecedented granularity for ASTE tasks. The percentage agreement between annotated triples by different annotators over the randomly sampled subset of the dataset is 79.74 %, at similarity threshold τ = 0.60. We also experimented with four baseline models on our datset and report results. The distinctiveness of the dataset emerges from its extension into the automotive domain, shedding light on sentiment dynamics specific to vehicles. With the fusion of extensive content and real-world applicability, MuSe-CarASTE presents a fertile ground for Natural Language Processing (NLP) innovation. Researchers, practitioners, and data scientists can harness MuSe-CarASTE to build and evaluate NLP models tailored for challenges in ASTE. These challenges encompass intricate aspect-opinion relationships, multi-word aspect and opinion extraction, and the subtleties of vague language. Moreover, including aspects not verbatim in sentences introduces a practical dimension to our dataset, enabling real-world applications like review pattern analysis, summarization, and recommender system enhancement. As a pioneering benchmark for NLP model evaluation in ABSA, MuSe-CarASTE integrates content richness, real-world context, and sentiment complexity. The integration empowers the development of accurate, adaptable, and insightful sentiment analysis models within the automotive review landscape.}

We propose the BERT-MAM model which approaches the ABSA task as a memory activation process regulated by memory decay and word similarity, implying that the importance of a word decays over time until it is reactivated by a similarity boost. We base experiments on the less commonly used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), to achieve competitive results in the Laptop and Restaurant datasets.}

Existing works have mainly focused on contrastive, meta, adversarial learning, or data augmentation but face issues like data scarcity, generalizability, and lack of coherence between text and targets. Moreover, stance detection must be interpretable to ensure transparency. Recent works with large language models (LLMs) aim to enhance unseen target knowledge or generate explanations but often rely excessively on explicit reasoning or provide coarse explanations, overlooking implicit cues and complicating interpretation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel interpretable multi-stage ZSSD framework. Stage 1 decodes explanations (rationales) justifying the stance while Stage 2 provides the final stance label, thus providing inherent interpretability in predicting stances. Extensive experiments prove that our approach outperforms other baselines with an average improvement in F1 scores of 27.99% with LLMs and 23.60% without LLMs for SemEval and 14.62% with LLMs and 25.24% without LLMs for VAST datasets for the ZSSD task, benefiting from the proposed pipeline architecture and interpretable design. Furthermore, to mitigate the harmful effects of offensive content and promote a more respectful online environment, we integrate an intervention module that leverages the contextual insights derived from our ZSSD framework with the ethics-based text generation power of LLMs to develop interventions. Automatic and human evaluation of LLM-generated interventions based on various proposed criteria provide insights into how LLMs perceive similar information from different perspectives, which can help foster morally sound and respectful online discourse.}

Despite their remarkable performance in natural language generating, LLMs lack a distinct focus on the emotion understanding domain. As a result, using LLMs for emotion recognition may lead to suboptimal and inadequate precision. Another limitation of the current LLMs is that they are typically trained without leveraging multi-modal information. To overcome these limitations, we formally model emotion recognition as text generation tasks, and thus propose DialogueLLM, a context and emotion knowledge tuned LLM that is obtained by fine-tuning foundation large language models. In particular, it is a context-aware model, which can accurately capture the dynamics of emotions throughout the dialogue. We also prompt ERNIE Bot with expert-designed prompts to generate the textual descriptions of the videos. To support the training of emotional LLMs, we create a large scale dataset of over 24K utterances to serve as a knowledge corpus. Finally, we offer a comprehensive evaluation of DialogueLLM on three benchmarking datasets and significantly outperform 15 state-of-the-art baselines and 3 state-of-the-art LLMs. The emotion intelligence test shows that DialogueLLM achieves 109 score and surpasses 72 % humans.

abstract = {Hate speech detection models often suffer from systemic misclassification due to biases in training data, particularly cognitive distortions in semantic associations learned in deep networks, making it especially challenging to identify implicit biases. While existing neuron pruning methods can mitigate explicit biases to some extent, removing parameters weakens the model’s semantic representation capability and struggles to address deeply ingrained cognitively distorted associations in deep networks. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a full-chain parallel residual compensation debiasing framework (PRCD). This framework introduces a residual compensation method for soft pruning (RCM), which enables soft pruning of bias signals across the entire model, from shallow to deep layers—without compromising the model’s semantic representation ability. Additionally, a toxicity constraint enhancement method based on sensitivity attribution prediction (ToxCon) is incorporated to generate contrastive samples that expose bias, effectively guiding RCM in correcting implicit biases stemming from cognitive distortions in semantic associations. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the PRCD significantly improves model performance and fairness in detecting hate speech, achieving state-of-the-art performance.}

abstract = {There has been a growing interest in multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition in recent years due to its wide range of practical applications. Multiple modalities allow for the integration of complementary information, improving the accuracy and precision of sentiment and emotion recognition tasks. However, working with multiple modalities presents several challenges, including handling data source heterogeneity, fusing information, aligning and synchronizing modalities, and designing effective feature extraction techniques that capture discriminative information from each modality. This paper introduces a novel framework called “Attention-based Multimodal Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Recognition (AMSAER)” to address these challenges. This framework leverages intra-modality discriminative features and inter-modality correlations in visual, audio, and textual modalities. It incorporates an attention mechanism to facilitate sentiment and emotion classification based on visual, textual, and acoustic inputs by emphasizing relevant aspects of the task. The proposed approach employs separate models for each modality to automatically extract discriminative semantic words, image regions, and audio features. A deep hierarchical model is then developed, incorporating intermediate fusion to learn hierarchical correlations between the modalities at bimodal and trimodal levels. Finally, the framework combines four distinct models through decision-level fusion to enable multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) dataset. The results confirm a notable performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods, attaining 85% and 93% accuracy for sentiment analysis and emotion classification, respectively. Additionally, when considering class-wise accuracy, the results indicate that the “angry” emotion and “positive” sentiment are classified more effectively than the other emotions and sentiments, achieving 96.80% and 93.14% accuracy, respectively.}

With the rise of graph convolution networks (GCNs), current ABSA models mostly use graph-based methods. These methods construct a dependency tree for each sentence, and regard each word as a unique node. To be more specific, they conduct classification using aspect representations instead of sentence representations, and update them with GCNs. However, this kind of method relies too much on the quality of the dependency tree and may lose the global sentence information, which is also helpful for classification. To deal with these, we design a new ABSA model AG-VSR. Two kinds of representations are proposed to perform the final classification, Attention-assisted Graph-based Representation (A2GR) and Variational Sentence Representation (VSR). A2GR is produced by the GCN module, which inputs a dependency tree modified by the attention mechanism. Furthermore, VSR is sampled from a distribution learned by a VAE-like encoder–decoder structure. Extensive experiments show that our model AG-VSR achieves competitive results.

Aspect sentiment quadruple prediction (ASQP) is a demanding and challenging task with the objective to predict four sentiment elements from given reviews. Existing methods for ASQP face certain issues, with pipeline-based non-generative approaches prone to error propagation and generative models at the potential risk of producing unexpected outputs or longer inference times. To avoid these shortcomings, we develop a novel end-to-end non-generative model for ASQP involving multi-task decomposition within machine reading comprehension (MRC) framework. Specifically, the ASQP task is decomposed into six query-induced subtasks by introducing task-specific question templates. The proposed model, named MRC-CLRI, is trained with multi-task joint learning. It also incorporates contrastive learning for category identification and sentiment classification to enhance the correlation of the six subtasks. To further promote the quadruple prediction, we present a refined inference algorithm in a bidirectional multi-turn inference procedure to effectively match aspect and opinion terms and optimize two inference hyperparameters: distance threshold and probability threshold. Experimental results exhibit superior performance compared to existing two non-generative and seven generative baselines. Our proposed MRC-CLRI, as a novel non-generative model, outperforms the best existing generative method by an average F1 score improvement of 1.69% and the best previous non-generative method by an average F1 score improvement of 15.77% across four review datasets. Ablation experiments further validate the efficacy of the designed contrastive learning and the refined inference algorithm.}

abstract = {Emotions play a pivotal role in daily judgments and decision-making, particularly in educational settings, where understanding and responding to learners’ emotions is essential for personalized learning. While there has been growing interest in emotion recognition, traditional methods, such as manual observations and self-reports, are often subjective and time-consuming. The rise of AI has led to the development of Automated Emotion Recognition (AER), offering transformative opportunities for educational reform by enabling personalized learning through emotional insights. However, AER continues to face challenges, including reliance on large-scale labeled databases, limited flexibility, and inadequate adaptation to diverse educational contexts. Recent advancements in AI, particularly Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), show promise in addressing these challenges, though their application in AER remains underexplored. This study aimed to fill this gap by systematically evaluating the performance of Gemini, a pioneering MLLM, in image-based AER tasks across five databases: CK+, FER-2013, RAF-DB, OL-SFED and DAiSEE. The analysis examined recognition accuracy, error patterns, emotion inference mechanisms, and the impact of image preprocessing techniques — such as face cropping, bilinear interpolation, and super-resolution — on the model’s performance. The results revealed that Gemini achieved high emotion recognition accuracy, especially in distinguishing emotional polarities across all databases. Image preprocessing significantly improved the recognition of basic emotions, though its effect on academic emotion recognition was minor. The confusion in academic emotion recognition stemmed from Gemini’s limited understanding of academic emotion features and its insufficient ability to capture contextual cues. Building on the results, this study outlines specific future research directions from both technological and educational perspectives. These findings offer valuable insights for advancing MLLMs in educational applications.}

In this paper, we firstly introduce a complete aspect sentiment analysis task, called Aspect Sentiment Quadruple Extraction, which also includes the category detection beside ATE, OTE and APC. Then we propose a two-stage neural network model composed of several modules, including BiLSTM, simple gated self-attention and position encoding for this joint task. In the first stage, the proposed model extracts aspect and opinion terms as well as their categories and polarities. Moreover, the second stage mainly includes a relation classifier to validate the aspect-opinion pairs and then finalizes the complete quadruple extraction. The experimental results, evaluated on a benchmark dataset of Chinese product reviews, show that our proposed model outperforms other baseline methods and achieves the start-of-art performance.}

The BiLSTM model was particularly effective in configurations with complex preprocessing, achieving an optimal F1 score of 61% through advanced noise removal, stemming, and a modified stop- words list. Conversely, the minimally preprocessed fine-tuned ’base-p2’ and ’large-p1’ BERT variants achieved F1 scores of 72% and 73%, respectively, both surpassing the previous best result of 71%. This research also explored 4 ensemble methods, combin- ing the strengths of the best-performing BiLSTM and BERT models using both soft-voting and stacked generalization techniques. The unweighted stacked generalization achieved a 74% F1 score, while the weighted method excelled with the highest F1 score of 75%, surpassing other models and highlighting the advantages of strategic model integration. This research significantly advances the development of NLP models for Indonesian text, demonstrating how tailored deep-learning approaches can effectively enhance emotion recognition accuracy.}

abstract = {The increasing interactive content in the Internet motivated researchers and data scientists to conduct Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) research to understand the various sentiments and the different aspects of a product in a single user’s comment. Determining the various aspects along with their polarities (positive, negative, or neutral) from a single comment is a challenging problem. To this end, we have designed and developed a deep learning model based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and features extracted using the Multilingual Universal Sentence Encoder (MUSE). The proposed Pooled-GRU model trained on a Hotels’ Arabic reviews to address two ABSA tasks: (1) aspect extraction, and (2) aspect polarity classification. The proposed model achieved high results with 93.0% F1 score in the former task and 90.86% F1 score in the latter task. Our experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the baseline model and the related research methods evaluated on the same dataset. More precisely, our proposed model showed 62.1% improvement in the F1 score over the baseline model for the aspect extraction task and 15% improvement in the accuracy over the baseline model for the aspect polarity classification task.}

abstract = {The task of cross-target stance detection faces significant challenges due to the lack of additional background information in emerging knowledge domains and the colloquial nature of language patterns. Traditional stance detection methods often struggle with understanding limited context and have insufficient generalization across diverse sentiments and semantic structures. This paper focuses on effectively mining and utilizing sentiment-semantics knowledge for stance knowledge transfer and proposes a sentiment-aware hierarchical attention network (SentiHAN) for cross-target stance detection. SentiHAN introduces an improved hierarchical attention network designed to maximize the use of high-level representations of targets and texts at various fine-grain levels. This model integrates phrase-level combinatorial sentiment knowledge to effectively bridge the knowledge gap between known and unknown targets. By doing so, it enables a comprehensive understanding of stance representations for unknown targets across different sentiments and semantic structures. The model’s ability to leverage sentiment-semantics knowledge enhances its performance in detecting stances that may not be directly observable from the immediate context. Extensive experimental results indicate that SentiHAN significantly outperforms existing benchmark methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness. Moreover, the paper employs ablation studies and visualization techniques to explore the intricate relationship between sentiment and stance. These analyses further confirm the effectiveness of sentence-level combinatorial sentiment knowledge in improving stance detection capabilities.}

abstract = {The prevalence of toxicity on social media platforms constitutes a significant issue. Gaining insights into the factors that contribute to toxicity is essential for devising effective strategies to mitigate it. In this work, we extend and evaluate fractional control SEIQR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Quarantined, Recovered) epidemiological modeling incorporating government interventions and awareness programs. The model incorporates different infected groups, moderate and high infected users, and is used to investigate the influence by each user on the overall spread of toxicity. We have evaluated the toxic post-free equilibrium point, the reproduction number (R0), the existence-uniqueness, and the stability point. We performed the model sensitivity analysis using the Latin Hypercube Sampling-Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (LHS-PRCC) method. For data fitting analysis, we examined data from COVID-19-related tweets. We examine the intricacies of the proposed numerical scheme, providing a robust framework for analyzing and comprehending online toxicity spread. Simulations were conducted to elucidate the effects of government interventions and public awareness programs on the prevalence and dynamics of online toxicity spread. The study’s primary accomplishment is the model’s reduction of the error rate to 0.0011. This is distinguished by the reduced need to remove users from the network. The model not only improves accuracy but also maintains a larger user base, indicating an efficient, user-centric strategy. The results suggest that both awareness programs and government interventions are crucial for managing and mitigating online toxicity spread. This study will significantly assist network providers and policymakers to identify the infected users, thereby reducing toxic conversations.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a special type of sentiment analysis that aims to identify the discussed aspects and their sentiment polarities in a given review. In this paper, two deep learning models are proposed to address essential aspect-based sentiment analysis tasks: aspect-category identification and aspect-sentiment classification. For the first task, an identification model is proposed based on a convolutional neural network and stacked independent long-short term memory. For the second task, a classification model is proposed based on stacked bidirectional independent long-short term memory, a position-weighting mechanism, and multiple attention mechanism layers. The proposed models are evaluated using the Arabic SemEval-2016 dataset for the Hotels domain. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models outperform the baseline and other models, where the first model, C-IndyLSTM, achieves an F1 measure of 58.08%, and the second model, MBRA, achieves an accuracy measure of 87.31%.}
