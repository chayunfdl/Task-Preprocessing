abstract = {Although live streaming commerce (LSC) has become a daily phenomenon in the digital economy, its spatial impact is still not yet fully understood. LSC is typical online-offline producer-customer intermediation type of the platform urbanism. Based on unique data from Huitun on the LSC activities in Taobao (Alibaba), we trace how digital streamers/platform with their own geographies connect suppliers with customers from different regions. Most digital streamers are located in urban areas, so they form a kind of urban intermediation among different regions. We argue that digital streamers, product suppliers, and customers form new urban systems because of their relational work and intermediation. We also show how intermediary cities emerge and change their positions in the new urban system. We demonstrate that retail is no longer based on the traditional service radius within a city but on a function of the intermediation of customers and suppliers from different regions. Finally, we provide evidence indicating that market access, transport infrastructure, and market consumption capacity are important factors that help explain such positions.}

abstract = {Background
Live-streaming e-commerce has emerged as a dynamic shopping medium, engaging consumers through interactive and immersive experiences. “Keeping Consumers in Suspense” (KCIS), encompassing preview fuzziness, suspense setting, and delight creation, is widely used to drive engagement and impulse buying. Still, its impact on consumer inner states and behaviors remains underexplored.
Objective
This study examines the influence of KCIS on consumer impulse buying behavior, focusing on the mediating roles of value perception and expectation perception.
Methods
Data were collected from 352 active users of Chinese live-streaming platforms using a structured survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) tested the relationships among KCIS dimensions, inner states, and impulse buying. A bootstrapping analysis with 5000 iterations assessed the stability and significance of mediating effects, supported by validity and reliability tests of newly developed KCIS constructs.
Results
Preview fuzziness (β = 0.35, p < 0.01) and suspense setting (β = 0.48, p < 0.01) significantly influenced value and expectation perception, while delight creation primarily affected expectation perception (β = 0.34, p < 0.01). Expectation perception mediated the relationship between KCIS and impulse buying more strongly (β = 0.35, p < 0.01) than value perception (β = 0.15, p < 0.05). Bootstrapping confirmed the robustness of these mediation effects.
Conclusion
KCIS strategies play a pivotal role in shaping consumer behavior in live-streaming e-commerce by influencing impulse buying through mechanisms such as value and expectation perception. The results highlight the effectiveness of preview fuzziness, suspense setting, and delight creation in enhancing consumer engagement and driving sales. These findings provide practical guidance for streamers to design tailored suspense tactics that maximize impact. Future research should extend this framework to diverse cultural contexts to validate its generalizability and explore additional influencing factors.}

However, critical gaps remain in current research: (1) inadequate theoretical modelling of multimodal information fusion, (2) limitations in the interpretability of predictive algorithms, (3) single-modality approaches restricting generalisability, and (4) unclear mechanisms linking cultural variation to live stream sales cycles. To address these gaps, we propose a novel Multimodal Dynamic Prediction Framework that integrates Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) for capturing multimodal dynamics in live-commerce forecasting. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our framework outperforms baseline approaches significantly. Key findings include: (1) Elucidation of a novel dual-track evolution of KOL influence, characterised by high sensitivity and rapid decay in emerging markets versus gradual penetration and sustained impact in mature markets. (2) Identification of core cyclical patterns underpinning the live streaming restructuring of traditional retail. (3) Temporal variation in multimodal feature contributions confirms an inverted U-shaped relationship between cognitive load and information digestion efficiency. Our framework provides actionable insights for precision marketing and dynamic KOL allocation, advancing both theory and practice in global e-commerce.}

abstract = {With live streaming becoming an integral part of a seller’s business strategy, a retailer can choose an influencer from a multi-channel network (MCN) to attract consumers. However, since the MCN may benefit from exaggerating the influencer’s historical live sales data, information asymmetry between the retailer and the MCN exists. This may lead the retailer to misestimate the influencer’s demand-enhancing capability (DEC), and then suffer loss. As the usage of blockchain in providing trust becomes more common, an MCN can apply blockchain technology to signal its data reliably to a retailer. However, conditions for MCN to adopt blockchain and its impact on retailer’s influencers choice has not been investigated so far. To fill this gap, we built a signaling model in which an MCN knows the actual information reliability whereas the retailer does not. We find that the retailer opens a live-streaming channel only if the operating cost is low but the retailer will use its own staff in the live streaming rather than an influencer from MCN if the commission is high. This makes the MCN to refrain from adopting blockchain technology. Meanwhile, the blockchain adoption decisions of the MCN and its impact on the retailer’s influencers choice not only depend on the adoption cost but also the commission. Specifically, when the adoption cost is low, a high-reliability MCN benefits more from adopting blockchain technology, which incentivizes the retailer to choose a high-DEC influencer; as the adoption cost increases, retailers become unable to judge the MCN’s information reliability, especially when the commission level is too low or too high; when the adoption cost increases to a moderate range, multiple equilibria co-exist, indicating that an MCN’s willingness to adopt blockchain technology depends on the retailer’s belief. We find that all equilibria survive the intuitive criterion, but, from both types of MCN’s perspectives, the equilibrium without blockchain adoption is always Pareto-dominant. When the adoption cost is high, an MCN has no incentive to adopt blockchain technology.}

In this context, we attempt to examine whether and when a retailer should launch a live streaming channel. If launched, we further investigate how the retailer should assort both national and store brand products across available channels. To delve into these questions, we consider a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and an online retailer, where the retailer resells the manufacturer's national brand product and also sells a store brand product. We examine the retailer's optimal channel strategy and product assortment strategy by considering six scenarios, differentiated by whether introducing the live streaming channel and various product assortment tactics. Our findings indicate that as long as the fixed setup cost of the live channel is relatively low, the retailer will always introduce a live streaming channel. The retailer's optimal assortment of both products across channels highly depends on the consumers’ additional value derived from the live streaming channel and the perceived quality of the store brand product. We also find that, the retailer's optimal channel strategy and product assortment may not always benefit the manufacturer, but there exist conditions that can create win-win situations for both players. Our study further shows that if the retailer launches the live streaming channel at the start, it may not always be necessary to introduce the store brand product under certain conditions.}

This paper studies two modes of live-streaming selling: merchant live-streaming and influencer live-streaming. Using linear demand functions, we model a game involving the manufacturer, streamers, and the platform. We derive the equilibrium results under these two modes: retail prices, streamer’s promotional effort level, and corresponding profits for all members. The results show that the appropriate mode of live-streaming adopted by the manufacturer is contingent on the commission rate of the streamer and the fixed signing bonus paid to the influencer. Secondly, introducing a live-streaming channel leads to more sales. However, the change in the retail price of the traditional online channel depends on the intensity of price competition between the traditional and live-streaming channels. Compared with the merchant live-streaming channel, although the influencer puts more effort into selling products, the retail price of the influencer live-streaming channel is not always lower, and the product sales are not always higher. Finally, by extending to the hybrid mode (i.e., merchant and influencer live-streaming channels are simultaneously adopted), numerical studies show that the manufacturer and the platform prefer the hybrid live-streaming mode but not streamers under certain conditions.}

Through in-depth interviews, Study 1 indicated that language provides clues about underlying mechanisms to rationalize this phenomenon. Three scenario-based experiments (i.e., Studies 2, 3a, and 3b) were subsequently conducted based on benign violation theory. Results show that using figurative language can lead to greater benign appraisal and further spur consumers' continuous watching intentions and purchase intentions in officers’ live streams. These effects are amplified when officers speak in the local dialect. This research enriches the understanding of officer live streaming from an organizational standpoint and is expected to help government officers choose suitable live-streaming strategies.}

The results show that, in the case of free product promotion, human agents are more effective at reducing consumer purchase hesitation. However, there is no significant difference in the impact of human agents and chatbots on purchase hesitation in the context of price discount promotions.

This paper analytically studies the introduction of LS selling in a supply chain wherein the manufacturer or the retailer should cooperate with streamers. By developing a game-theoretic model, we explore three possible modes for introducing LS selling and investigate the effects on supply chain members and consumers. Our main findings are as follows. First, retailer LS selling makes the retailer better off, and the manufacturer benefits from such mode only when the streamer’s ability to sell is high. Second, manufacturer LS selling does not always hurt the retailer, which can result in a win–win outcome for all supply chain members. Third, we find that when the consumers’ acceptance of LS selling is low, manufacturer LS selling is the optimal choice; when the acceptance is high, the optimal strategy depends on the streamer’s ability to sell and streamer’s popularity. Fourth, the result shows that consumers can exactly benefit from LS shopping if the retailer introduces the LS selling, while they would be worse off in some cases if the manufacturer introduces such selling channel. In addition, we also make some extensions to explore the effect of LS selling on firms and consumers.}

Key findings include: (1) In high-commission environments, platforms and merchants are better aligned, increasing the likelihood of merchants adopting truthful advertising strategies. (2) In high-profit environments, the temptation for merchants to engage in false advertising rises, prompting platforms to adopt blockchain technology to maintain transparency. (3) Although blockchain technology adoption enhances platform reputation over the long term, its direct impact on merchants’ advertising strategies is limited. (4) Regulatory measures such as fines and consumer reporting rewards promote blockchain technology adoption and reduce false advertising. These findings provide valuable insights for enhancing the credibility of live-streaming e-commerce and offer guidance for platforms on balancing technology adoption with regulatory efforts to foster sustainable industry development.}

We consider a supply chain composed of a manufacturer and a retailer with two live streaming scenarios: ML and RL. In scenario ML (RL), the manufacturer (retailer) invites an influencer to open a live streaming channel. We explore the impacts of influencer power and consider the integration of metaverse technology. Our analytical results reveal the following: Under scenario ML, the adoption of metaverse technology increases the manufacturer’s optimal profit at a moderate unit cost of metaverse technology with high influencer power or at a low unit cost. When the manufacturers introduce live streaming, they should adopt metaverse technology when choosing influencers with relatively high influencer power as the unit cost is moderate in the development phase of metaverse technology. Under scenario RL, the retailer should only adopt metaverse technology at a high unit cost with low influencer power or at a low unit cost with high influencer power. This implies a counterintuitive strategy: when cooperating with influencers with lower influencer power, the retailers should adopt metaverse technology despite high costs. Furthermore, regardless of metaverse technology adoption, scenario RL (ML) brings more profit to the manufacturer if influencer power is low (high). This indicates that manufacturers and retailers should choose influencers with greater influence power when introducing live streaming. By extending our model, we examine the robustness of our findings under the scenarios involving channel competition, omni-channel strategy, and live streaming slicing. This study is the first to explore the adoption strategies of metaverse technology in different live streaming supply chain structures considering consumer returns, providing valuable guidance for manufacturers and retailers on when to adopt metaverse technology.}

This disrupted the long-term cooperative relationship between the platforms and farmers. Based on this, our paper explores that whether and how the agricultural supply chain members should adopt the live streaming channel. We build a game model that consists of a farmer, a platform, and an influencer, and investigate the live streaming introduction strategies in the agricultural supply chain in the context of the platform assisting the farmer (the improvement of quality level and adoption of blockchain). We capture two characteristics of the live streaming channel, i.e., the live streaming channel’s impact on market size (live streaming value) and additional profit per unit product derived from the influencer’s personal influence (influencer value). We interestingly find that when the live streaming value is low, introducing live streaming negatively impacts the farmer’s profit at the low influencer value in the farmer’s live streaming. When the live streaming value is low (high), introducing live streaming damages the platform’s profit at the moderate (low) influencer value in the platform’s live streaming. Therefore, adopting the live streaming channel is not necessarily profitable for agricultural supply chain members. We also extend our model to check the robustness of our findings. This study is the first to explore live streaming introduction strategies in the agricultural supply chain in the context of the platform assisting the farmer, and significantly contributes to the literature and provides valuable guidance for farmers and platforms on when to adopt the live streaming channel in the agricultural supply chain.}

Our findings show that product selling and virtual tipping in live streaming interact through the moderating effect of social utility. As the size of followers increases, manufacturers tend to lower product prices in live streaming to stimulate both purchasing and tipping behaviors. However, continuously reducing the price is not an optimal strategy. Additionally, we demonstrate that live stream selling represents a win-win option for both influencers and manufacturers compared to direct selling. Interestingly, influencers with relatively small follower bases are even willing to sell manufacturers’ products without charging a commission. These insights deepen the understanding of live stream selling and virtual tips, offering practical guidance for live streaming professionals to make informed strategic decisions.}

abstract = {Live streaming e-commerce, as an emerging form of social media and platform, is developing rapidly in recent years. To realize rapid growth in user base, some live streaming e-commerce platforms are devoted to release positive cross-side network effects (CNEs) by introducing a key opinion leader (KOL). However, the KOL's strong ability in generating contents and promoting products would cannibalize the viewership and sales of small and medium-sized live-streamers (SMLs), leading to detrimental same-side network effects (SNEs) that hinder the growth of the user base. In this paper, we consider the joint influence of CNEs and SNEs to investigate the KOL introduction strategy and pricing decision of live streaming e-commerce platforms, and analyze the impacts of the KOL introduction on platforms' equilibrium decisions and user participation. Our finding indicates that network effects significantly affect pricing strategy only when platforms introduce the KOL. In this case, it could be more advantageous for platforms to subsidize SMLs with weak CNE intensity while charging the KOL with strong CNE intensity. Moreover, our paper also reveals an interesting result. Although the platforms improve (reduce) the entry fee on SMLs, the access quantities of SMLs still increase (decrease) when the KOL entries. Finally, our analysis reveals that the platforms may introduce the KOL even though its negative SNE intensity on SMLs is strong, while may not introduce when its negative SNE intensity on SMLs is weak.}

abstract = {In the digital commerce era, live-stream has become an essential sales channel, prompting manufacturers to strategically select among merchant employees, low-influence streamers (L-streamers) and high-influence streamers (H-streamers). Few studies comparatively analyze how sales effort and dynamic commission rate influence manufacturers' profitability and channel selection. This study bridges this gap by developing a dual-channel model to evaluate these two incentive mechanisms. Results indicate that at equal commission rates, L-streamers consistently yield higher profits than merchant employees, whereas H-streamers only outperform employees at higher commission rates for products easily sold via live-stream. Additionally, L-streamers generate higher profits than H-streamers under identical commission rates. In post-effort scenarios, increasing commission rate motivates sales effort from streamers and employees, significantly affecting manufacturers' channel preferences. Specifically, manufacturers prefer merchant employees at lower commission rates and shift towards L-streamers at higher rates. The choice between merchant employees and H-streamers depends on product characteristics, hassle cost and disutility factor: H-streamers are favored at higher commission rates for easily sellable products, while merchant employees are preferred when the traditional online channel retains clear advantages. Furthermore, manufacturers’ preferences between pre- and post-effort scenarios vary by hassle cost and commission rate. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of dynamic commission structure relative to sales effort incentive, guiding manufacturers in optimizing channel strategies and commission structures to achieve sustained profitability and channel stability.}

The conceptual framework of the study integrates the concepts of the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) framework in conjunction with the Five-Factor Model (Big Five). Data were collected from 401 online questionnaires collected by users with no more than three months of ELS experience and causal relationships were analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. The study found that promotion (PROM), Content Quality (CTQ) and Content Valence (CTV) played a crucial role in driving viewer interest in booking through hotel live-streaming (HLS). Viewers with the Extraversion personality type (EXT) show interest in booking accommodations through the hotel e-commerce live streaming platform. Financial and privacy concerns influence the assessment of payment options. In addition, finances and dissatisfaction are essential factors that encourage viewers to hesitate to pay after booking. This study is crucial for applying ELS in the tourism and hospitality industry to create new travel experiences post-COVID-19.}

This study addresses this gap by proposing a theoretical framework that integrates affordance-based gratifications, user identification, and user engagement. Drawing upon the uses and gratifications theory, social media engagement theory, and social identity theory, we conducted a survey with 565 participants in mainland China. The findings reveal that interactivity-based gratifications significantly influence both preliminary and further levels of engagement, while modality-based gratifications primarily impact preliminary engaging behaviors. Furthermore, user identification acts as a mediating factor in the relationship between affordance-based gratifications and engagement. These results offer valuable empirical evidence for scholars and practitioners to consider technological factors and streamers’ roles while examining user engagement on game live streaming platforms. The study suggests enhancing interactivity functions and emphasizing the role of live streamers to foster user engagement. By understanding the importance of technological affordances, this research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of engagement in the game live streaming industry.}

abstract = {E-commerce live streaming is reshaping online retail by combining real-time interaction, social connectivity, and personalization, yet most prior work isolates these drivers. Addressing that limitation, this study applies socio-technical systems theory and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to investigate how social elements (beauty, humor, passion, expertise, warmth), technical features (interactivity, personalization), and customer value dimensions (hedonic, utilitarian) jointly drive or hinder customer-engagement behavior (CEB). Using data from 682 Indonesian viewers, the analysis reveals three configurations that lead to high CEB, all of which contain personalization + both customer-value dimensions, yet differ on the social side—showing, for example, that beauty or warmth can be absent without harming engagement when humor, passion, and expertise are present. Conversely, two absence-heavy recipes produce low CEB; notably, one reveals that even robust streamer cues and interactivity cannot rescue engagement when personalization and perceived value are lacking. These findings extend socio-technical systems theory by underscoring the intricate interdependence among social, technical, and value resources. Methodologically, fsQCA demonstrates a robust approach for examining nuanced, multi-factor influences. Practically, the study provides guidance for platforms and streamers—emphasizing the importance of balancing emotional appeal, interactive features, and customer-value dimensions—to maximize engagement in the fast-growing landscape of e-commerce live streaming.}

Quality of user Experience (QoE) is a vital quantitative criterion for evaluating user satisfaction while watching live broadcasts, and it is positively correlated with the increase in the income of Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Video stalling identification plays a crucial role in the evaluation of QoE. However, encrypted live streaming hides video content, which makes identifying video stalling challenging. Existing studies primarily detect video stalling in a fixed time interval and focus on high-dimensional features. However, the capacity of the client byte buffer is dynamic, resulting in the stalling and non-stalling existing in a certain and fixed stalling time. In addition, the handling time of abundant features causes further latency. We propose Truncation of Dynamic Bytes and non-linear Integrated Modification based on Double Buffers (DB2) to identify video stalling under HTTP-FLV protocol in various network conditions and live types. We pull real-time video to get client buffer parameters and build a dynamic mapping based on the double buffer between network packets and the video playing states. This allows a more objective and precise evaluation of video stalling. We design a new network feature by creating a non-linear relationship between network packets and the client buffer. This is achieved by combining non-linear convergent distribution with basic traffic features. The feature is fed into a lightweight machine learning model to train the classifier, achieving low processing latency and high identification accuracy. The experimental results show that DB2 can achieve 98.91% stalling identification accuracy with 1.256 ms operation time in a mixture of live video types, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.}

This study examines the adoption of live streaming selling by considering customers interacting with the streamer in real-time to acquire more product information and additional interaction value. Three sales models are constructed: the traditional selling channel (Model T), the live streaming selling channel (Model L), and the dual channel that combines traditional selling and live streaming selling (Model TL). The impact of live streaming selling on value creation is revealed through a comparative analysis. Finally, as an extension model, we consider the scenario where manufacturers pay streamers different commissions based on actual market demands. The results show that adopting live streaming selling depends on the commission and operating costs of live streaming. When the commission paid to the streamer is low, contemplating live streaming selling can create more value for all parties. When the commission is moderate, the manufacturer should adopt the dual channel of traditional selling and live streaming selling to create more value. Conversely, when the commission and operating costs are high, adopting live streaming selling is not recommended. Furthermore, when market demand is high, manufacturers achieve greater profits by paying streamers a fixed commission. Conversely, when market demand is low, manufacturers gain higher profits by paying streamers different commissions based on actual market demand.}

Based on the Social Exchange Theory (SET), and take the current new type of online community, the social live-streaming community, as the research object, this study investigates how Para-social Interaction (PSI) between users and streamers affects users' perceived benefits, whether perceived benefits are related to users' community commitment and the relationship between community commitment and CCB from the perspective of value co-creation. Three hundred and forty-seven valid samples from China were obtained using TikTok and subsequently analyzed via Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The analysis results show that PSI positively influences users' perceived benefits, and among the perceived benefits, hedonic and self-esteem benefits can positively influence users' community commitment. When users' community commitment to live-streamers exists, it can effectively incentivize users to develop CCB. Theoretically, research findings enrich the study of online community value co-creation, para-social interaction, and citizenship behavior and provide recommendations for operating social live-streaming platforms.}

We employ both machine learning and econometric methods to analyze a unique dataset of 55,096 shows by the top 1,000 live streamers on Alibaba’s live streaming platform. We identify three distinct clusters. The most important differentiating features include a live streamer’s platform affiliation and product category. Selling more products and spending more time on each product in a live-streaming show are two factors driving both GMV and fan growth. We also discover that a large fan base does not always help, as the positive effect of fan base only exists conditionally.}

This study uses an experimental approach based on Hovland's persuasion model and the selectivity hypothesis to examine the effects of streamers' source dynamism on purchase intentions and whether the experience resulting from the streamer–consumer interaction is moderated by gender. Findings show that consumers' purchase intention is positively correlated with the source dynamism of streamers and with their perception of para-social interaction and vicarious product experience. In addition, results reveal that gender significantly moderates the relationship between consumers' vicarious product experience and purchase intentions. Females have a stronger vicarious product experience than males and, thus, higher purchase intention when they perceive the high source dynamism of streamers. Lastly, findings highlight the need for brands and suppliers to consider source dynamism when choosing streamers and to allow making different marketing decisions for different consumer genders.}

abstract = {The emergence of live-streaming channels has changed the traditional online channels though, and has opened up opportunities for manufacturers. We consider a manufacturer cooperating with an online platform operating with two selling channels: live-streaming and agency channels. The manufacturer can choose an internal or external anchor to introduce its products in the live-streaming channel. The external anchor charges a commission whereas the internal anchor does not. In addition, we incorporate three features of the live-streaming channel, namely “encroaching effect”, “long-term effect”, and “live-interaction efficiency”. We reveal that no matter whether to adopt metaverse technology, inviting an external anchor brings the manufacturer more (less) profit than deploying an internal anchor at a low (high) live-interaction efficiency. However, inviting the external anchor first brings the platform lower, then higher, and finally lower profit than deploying the internal anchor as the long-term effect increases. In addition, no matter which anchor is deployed, adopting metaverse technology brings the manufacturer lower (higher) profit than that without metaverse technology at a low (high) live-interaction efficiency. However, adopting metaverse technology brings the platform more (less) profit than that without metaverse technology at a low (high) unit metaverse-enabled benefit.}

The impulsive live streaming consumption intentions of the Southeast Asian market are examined in this study. Online live streaming transactions, a new form of social media, are becoming popular due to their real-time communication and innovative business concept. Though little attention has been dedicated to it, a theoretical knowledge of Live Streaming Transaction (LST) is crucial given its broad application and unique features. The analysis of 8613 respondents from Southeast Asia in this study, based on flow, temperament, and personality theories, offers fresh perspectives on the mediating role of flow and the moderating effect of temperament in a cross-national setting. Cluster sampling was used to construct a mixed-method conditional indirect effects model. Since introverted temperament types look for voices that echo within them, our findings revealed that LSTs are more intriguing to this market segment. Theoretical and practical elements, as well as implications for future directions, are presented.}

Additionally, the brand will establish a brand-based live-streaming channel on the platform. Confronted with the two live-streaming forms, the platform adopts diverse traffic support strategies, resulting in a range of impacts. This study introduces a model in which a brand sells products on a live-streaming platform through both KOL-based and brand-based live-streaming channels. The platform has the option to choose from several traffic support strategies. By analyzing the optimal support strategy for the platform, this study draws the following conclusions: (1) Although the platform can generate more revenue from KOL-based live-streaming, it may still choose to provide only traffic support for brand-based live-streaming. (2) Contrary to intuitive expectations, the value of live-streaming platforms, brands, and KOLs’ traffic support strategies may decrease as technical service rates increase. (3) Consumer surplus reaches a maximum when the platform uses the same level of traffic support in both channels. Notably, the value of the traffic support strategy for consumers may still increase as the technical service rate increases.}

The effects of parasocial guanxi on consumer dissatisfaction and complaint intention in service failure situations were further investigated based on the expectation confirmation theory. Our study involved 425 valid questionnaires and employed the partial least squares structural equation method (PLS-SEM). The findings are mixed: on one side, parasocial guanxi acts as a buffer, mitigating dissatisfaction and complaint intention in the face of product or service problems and reducing the impact of disconfirmation on consumer dissatisfaction. On the other side, it may also increase the likelihood of dissatisfied consumers complaining. Furthermore, the buffering effect weakens as consumers make more frequent purchases. The findings have important theoretical and practical implications for understanding the buyer-seller relationship in live streaming commerce.}

However, current research mainly centers on live streaming in commerce and entertainment, overlooking its affordances for episodic learning. Drawing from classic vicarious learning (VL) paradigms, and considering the perspectives of social media affordances and parasocial interaction, we propose a theoretical model for examining VL in live streaming and address research gaps. The proposed theoretical model was tested and validated through a three-wave data collection survey (t1, N = 504; t2, N = 438; t3, N = 256) from four popular Chinese live-streaming platforms. The results reveal two main forms of VL (i.e., independent and coactive), which users engage in to enhance their knowledge adoption in live streaming. Parasocial interaction, on one hand, directly affects knowledge adoption in live streaming, while VL plays a partial mediating role in the effect. Moreover, both VL and parasocial interaction benefit from social media affordances (i.e., browsing others' content, communication, metavoicing, and relationship formation). More important, although knowledge consensus can strengthen the impact of VL on knowledge adoption, it negatively moderates the influence of parasocial interaction on knowledge adoption. Our study extends the applicability of VL to knowledge adoption in computer-mediated communication contexts (CMC) and provides practical suggestions for how social media practitioners and designers facilitate viewer learning behavior.}

Then, we examine the pricing decisions in different channels of the e-seller considering live-streaming selling, it shows that the price in the live-streaming channel is not always lower, which is dependent on the live streamer’s sales ability. Moreover, both the e-seller and the live streamer consistently prefer the e-seller to operate the live-streaming channel when introducing the live-streaming channel within a specific range of slotting fee. Finally, the research was extended to a hybrid channel scenario, and the results reveal that the e-seller may not consistently benefit from such configurations.}

Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) analysis have been performed to extract the findings. The results showed that financial, social, and structural bonds positively influence trust. Trust has an encouraging influence on the internal perception process, leading to purchase intention. Additionally, trust reduces product uncertainty, which ultimately diminishes purchase intention. Influencers and companies interested in live-streaming should focus on relational bonds, consumers' internal perception processes, and reducing product uncertainty. Additionally, the ANN's non-linear output provided further insight into the significance of cognitive drivers.

Using analytical models, we first explore whether and when two competing online retailers to adopt the live streaming sales strategy in an online market with spillover effects. Furthermore, the implications of their optimal strategies on CS and SW are analyzed. Lastly, we relax our assumptions to consider some general scenarios: (1) When the two online retailers engage in sequential pricing, and (2) when some consumers are time-constrained. The main findings are as follows: (1) Online retailers should sometimes sell their products via live streaming, even though it is more likely to send a low quality signal to consumers. Although the positive spillover effects of other competitors’ live streams are strong, retailers may prefer their competitors to adopt the regular selling mode. (2) CS and SW would be significantly improved by the introduction of the live streaming mode when live streams can greatly enhance consumers’ quality beliefs and their spillover effects are relatively strong but not too strong. (3) Pricing sequences do not affect the optimal live streaming sales strategy, while the presence of time-constrained consumers makes online retailers less likely to sell through live streaming.}

Exploring the channel effect (e.g., the use of innovative sales channels) in addressing supply risks is essential to understanding the viability of e-commerce supply chains. Motivated by the emergence of live-streaming channels in the “new normal”, in this study, we consider an e-commerce supply chain facing supply risks. Capturing supply risks by a random supply viability, we investigate the channel decision on whether to introduce live streaming and the platform's optimal selling format selection (between reselling and marketplace). We prove that live streaming can help address supply risks because it can utilize the streamer's sales effort to impact the live-streaming retail price and create more flexibility. We confirm that a sufficiently high live-streaming efficiency is crucial for introducing a live-streaming channel. Interestingly, we uncover that high volatility of supply risks incentivizes the adoption of live streaming. We also find that incorporating live streaming may change the e-tailer's selling format preferences because the reselling format exhibits a higher acceptance of live streaming than the marketplace one, which is further influenced by the combined influence of live streaming and supply risks. Our results imply that live streaming plays a positive role in maintaining supply chain viability by enhancing the supply chain's overall ability to address supply risks. This paper provides scientific evidence on the importance of having a live-streaming channel in addressing supply risks in the new normal.}

Broadcasters and viewers in the transaction-oriented category focus on products and transactions and tend to communicate with non-emotional words in live chats. In contrast, broadcasters and viewers might treat each other as friends and are more likely to post emotional words in the relationship-oriented category. Our econometric model shows a curvilinear association between relationship-oriented social interactions and viewer purchase behaviors. The empirical analysis indicates that to achieve higher sales, LSC broadcasters should make relationship-oriented social interactions in live chat account for 58.64% of the probabilities.

Users watch streamers’ performances and purchase virtual gifts for their favorite streamers. There are two types of streamers: non-contracted ones who stream independently and contracted ones who sign with and work for the platform. Based on observed industrial practice, the platform provides non-contracted streamers with a straight commission plan and contracted streamers with one of three alternative compensation plans, namely, the basic compensation plan (B-plan), salary-based incentive plan (SI-plan), and commission-based incentive plan (CI-plan). The platform first decides its compensation plans for two types of streamers, then the streamers decide their type and effort level. We explore and compare the streamers’ optimal decisions under different compensation plans. We interestingly find that the SI/CI bonus does not always motivate streamers to perform better. The SI bonus is only effective for the streamers whose ability is neither low nor high while the CI bonus can effectively motivate the majority of streamers except those having extremely low ability or some low-intermediate-ability streamers. In addition, the platform can screen out low-ability streamers and attract high-ability streamers to sign with it by properly designing its compensation plans. Finally, we examine managerial insights for the platform. We show that both SI-plan and CI-plan result in higher expected profits for the platform than the B-plan.}

In study 1, we compute 12 variables in accordance with hypotheses from nonfused trimodal data (verbal, vocal, and visual). XGBoost and Shapley additive explanations are used to evaluate the importance of these 12 variables, and economic models are adopted to test their statistical significance. In study 2, we reduce the data granularity of the 12 coarse-grained variables by generating 323 fine-grained features. We then process trimodal data fusion to consider intra- and intermodal interactions. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are applied to learn a mapping from the input sequences of trimodality to output values of follower increment. The results demonstrate that early fusion LSTM with fused trimodal features has a 66.3% prediction accuracy, outperforming LSTM with unimodal features and late fusion LSTM with nonfused trimodal features. To our knowledge, these results are among the first to unfold follower attraction strategies with unstructured video data, and this is the first study to provide knowledge-and-data-driven multimodal machine learning models for predicting follower attraction at different granularity levels.}

In this article, we explore the current research on influencing factors in live-streaming, to identify the state of the field and inform future research. A scoping review was conducted to map the currently researched topics and factors, to find emerging or understudied topics, and to analyze the state of multidisciplinary and multicultural cooperation. Two iterations of a literature search and a citation-based literature mapping were used to collect 348 peer-reviewed entries. Identified and classified themes were analyzed along with visualizations of the local citation network, concept co-occurrence, and an inter-country citation graph. As a result, the main actors, genres, and issues in live-streaming, the frequency with which they are researched, and their trends over time were identified and described. Games and esports dominate research; topics recently gaining interest are e-commerce, mental health, collaboration and teaching using streams, and promoting tourism using streams. The body of literature is well connected; scientific disciplines and research groups seem to be aware of each other.

abstract = {Live-streaming e-commerce is revolutionizing online retail by fostering real-time consumer engagement, yet limited research explores how streamer and platform characteristics jointly influence trust and drive consumer engagement behaviors (CEB). This study examines how streamer attributes (beauty, humor, passion, expertise, and warmth) and platform features (interactivity and personalization) shape trust in streamers and products, subsequently affecting CEB dimensions, including augmenting, co-developing, influencing, and mobilizing. Using data from 682 respondents and analyzing with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) via SmartPLS 4.0, the findings reveal that beauty and interactivity are pivotal for trust in streamers, while expertise and personalization are critical for trust in products. Trust in streamers emerged as the strongest predictor of CEB, emphasizing its role in fostering consumer loyalty and interaction. This research contributes to theory by integrating socio-technical perspectives with trust-based consumer engagement frameworks, offering a holistic understanding of trust to cultivate CEB. Practically, the study highlights the importance of employing streamers with strong interpersonal appeal and creating interactive, personalized shopping experiences to boost trust and engagement. The study advances live-streaming e-commerce by providing insights and presenting an original, trust-driven model for enhancing consumer engagement.}

abstract = {Live-streaming commerce serves as a novel marketing tool in the digital era, facilitating real-time interactions between streamers and customers to enhance product sales. However, the transition back to solely traditional online channels following live-stream events presents decision-making challenges for firms regarding dynamic pricing, price commitment, and price matching schemes, particularly when dealing with strategic customers. We develop a two-period theoretical model to explore the selection of pricing schemes by a firm who may launch a live-streaming sales. Our analysis reveals that while live-streaming cannot necessarily enhance profitability under price commitment scheme, it significantly boosts profits under dynamic pricing and price matching schemes due to amplified pricing flexibility. The increased customer patience in strategic waiting diminishes the benefits of live-streaming under dynamic pricing, whereas it enhances them under price matching with reimbursement mechanisms. Moreover, dynamic pricing and price matching schemes, traditionally perceived as less favorable, emerge as potentially more effective due to the real-time value enhancement effect of live-streaming commerce, which can mitigate customers’ strategic delay in purchasing decisions. The firm’s selection of an optimal pricing scheme under live-streaming commerce can also maximize consumer surplus, thereby enhancing social welfare and promoting a positive image of corporate social responsibility advocated by governmental bodies. This “win-win-win” scenario for the firm, customers, and government can be achieved through dynamic pricing or price commitment schemes. In this context, a conducive social environment can be fostered, enabling all participants to collaborate in expanding opportunities and benefiting everyone.}

These qualities have positioned live streaming as a major venue for influencer marketing, where brands collaborate with influencers to promote products to engaged viewers. However, this study suggests that influencer marketing within live streaming may lead to a decline in viewership as viewers experience resistance toward sponsored content. Building on the persuasion knowledge model, we analyze this phenomenon using streaming data from Twitch.tv and apply propensity score matching (PSM) to assess viewership trends. Our findings reveal a significant decline in viewership associated with influencer marketing. We also identify strategies that streamers can employ to mitigate this negative impact. First, moderate levels of real-time interaction between streamers and viewers help alleviate viewership reduction. Second, streamers who diversify their content topics experience less viewership declines. Lastly, minimizing negative content reduces the adverse effect on viewership. These findings contribute to the literature on influencer marketing and live streaming, offering practical insights for firms and streamers aiming to enhance audience engagement.}

Results show that live streaming with background music increase consumer's purchase intention and arousal. Specifically, background music playing during purchase phase leads to higher purchase intention and consumer memory than continuous playing. Continuous playing induces higher arousal than background music playing during purchase phase. Process measures reveal that playing during purchase phase (vs. continuous playing) reduces arousal, thus enhancing consumer memory and leads to higher purchase intention. Continuous playing, however, induces arousal but impairs consumer memory, subsequently leading to lower purchase intention.}

The exponential growth of live streaming commerce has made it a prominent sales channel, yet limited research explores its impact from the perspective of retail atmospherics. This study aims to develop an integrated model examining how live streaming atmospherics influence consumers' post-purchase intentions. It specifically focuses on how consumer perceptions of expertise and time scarcity affect the cognitive processes leading to purchase behaviors.
Design
Grounded in the Stimulus–Organism–Response (S-O-R) framework, this study collected 842 valid survey responses to test its hypotheses. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to evaluate the relationships among live streaming atmospherics, perceived expertise, and consumer post-purchase intentions.
Findings
Results indicate that aesthetic cues and bullet screen mutuality are key dimensions of live streaming atmospherics that positively influence consumers' post-purchase intentions. Additionally, time scarcity strengthens the positive impact of perceived expertise on consumers' intentions to post comments and recommend products, highlighting its moderating role in consumer decision-making processes.
Originality
This study provides a novel perspective on the impact of live streaming atmospherics on consumer behavior, filling a research gap by integrating expertise perception and time scarcity into the S-O-R framework. Practical examples from prominent e-commerce platforms such as Taobao Live and JD Live are incorporated to demonstrate how aesthetic design and interactive features in real-world scenarios enhance consumer post-purchase behaviors.}

Accurate product return prediction is highly desirable for the vendors to optimize their business operations in advance to reduce return-related costs. This paper proposes a novel approach, called Contraformer (Contrastive transformer), to predict product returns in live streaming e-commerce by leveraging fine-grained streamer behavior features extracted from three modalities (i.e., visual, acoustic, and language). The primary contribution lies in that we adopt Transformer with the encoder-decoder architecture with a novel class-supervised contrastive learning (CSCL) to fuse streamer behavior for multimodal representation alignment and inter-modal interaction characterization. By using a real-world dataset with 2584 product streamers and 864 items collected from Tiktok China live streaming platform, we demonstrate that the proposed Contrasformer approach outperforms the baseline methods in predicting product return rate with a 25 % reduction in terms of mean absolute error. This study offers great managerial implications for vendors to manage their practice in live streaming commerce.}

However, it is essential to highlight the growing prevalence of limited sales as a popular marketing strategy within these live-streaming channels, resulting in an inability to fulfill all consumer demands. Surprisingly, this phenomenon has gone largely unnoticed in previous literature. This paper aims to bridge this gap by delving into the impact of product shortages within the realm of live-streaming commerce. To accomplish this objective, we introduce a stylized model that captures the strategic interactions between online retailers and consumers within live-streaming channels featuring rationed product availability. Our findings reveal that the online retailer’s profit exhibits a unimodal trend concerning the quantity of products offered in the live-streaming channel when the product value falls within a non-extreme range. In simpler terms, deliberately limiting product availability in live-streaming commerce can lead to significantly higher profits, incentivizing retailers to implement rationing strategies. Moreover, contrary to conventional expectations that consumers anticipate a greater supply of products than the retailer intends to provide, we uncover that consumers expect a lower quantity when the potential product value is relatively small. Finally, our research highlights that while live-streaming channels attract consumers with high patience, encouraging their engagement, impatient consumers who favor traditional online channels may face long-term adverse effects due to the retailer’s strategic pricing response. We validate the robustness of our main findings by exploring various extensions, such as the influence of strategic waiting behavior, advertising effects and enhanced perceived product value.}

Different from other social media, TikTok offers a new feature, namely TikTok Live, participants can use this social media for their entertainment as well as a buying and selling platform. At the same time, live streaming also faces several factors where consumers are not yet sure about buying it. However, the marketing strategy has recently become a hot topic of discussion. Therefore, this empirical research aimed to investigate why Indonesian consumers buy on live streaming using perceived trust as a mediating variable, such as trust in the products and trust in the sellers. The factors used to analyse the influence on consumers' purchase intention include utilitarian value, hedonic value and social value. This study collected data in a questionnaire created in Google Forms and performed data analysis using SPSS 26 and SPSS Amos software, using structural equation models to analyse validation and theoretical hypotheses. The results of this analysis are expected to provide knowledge to social commerce providers, especially in the area of live streaming. This study shows that perceived values such as utilitarian, hedonic and social values have a significant positive impact on purchase intention. Utilitarian value and social value both have a significant and positive influence on both consumer trust in the products and consumer trust in the platform, but not on hedonic value, where hedonic value only has a significant positive influence on trust in the platform, but an insignificant effect on trust in the product. Even though hedonic value has no influence on the product, sellers still need to provide a more pleasant atmosphere to attract the attention of users or consumers. And for further research, this study hopes to uncover additional elements that influence consumer behaviour on the TikTok live streaming platform.}

Using the PLS-SEM method, survey data from 306 tourists who watch tourism livestreams every day were analyzed. The analysis identified two factors that contribute to tourists' psychological fatigue: perceived information homogeneity and perceived e-servicescape homogeneity. Tourists' reactions to homogeneity include an internal processing organism, encompassing three dimensions of psychological fatigue: cognitive, emotional, and motivational. The ultimate behavioral response to these fatigues is intentional avoidance.

Quantifying user-user interaction with BERT model, we then perform a sentiment analysis using the Baidu API. The results of our analysis demonstrate that entertainment-type and information-type user interaction have a significant positive effect on flow, including user stay time, number of danmaku, number of people sending danmaku.

Based on nationally representative data (n = 7701) collected via Douyin, a leading live streaming e-commerce platform in China, the study adopts PLS-SEM to test how social presence of the streamer (SSP) and that of other viewers (VSP) affect consumers' purchase intention (PI). A comprehensive framework integrating SSP, VSP, loneliness (LN), and consumer experience (CE) is proposed to understand consumers' PI in the context of live streaming shopping. It is found that SSP, VSP as well as CE, have direct positive effects on consumers' PI. Different roles played by social presence of two social actors are identified. Specifically, SSP exhibits a more pronounced impact on both CE and consumers' PI compared to VSP. Notably, contrary to the role of SSP in alleviating consumers' LN, VSP is found to significantly intensify consumers' LN, which implies that digital coexistence of other viewers in the live streaming shopping context may not provide consumers with a positive sense of companionship. LN affects consumers' PI via a complete mediation effect of CE, underscoring the vital role of CE in shaping consumers' PI in the live streaming shopping context, which also implies potentially distinct internal processes between current context of concern and traditional offline contexts. Moderating effect analyses reveal that LN negatively moderates the total effects of SSP on both CE and PI, indicating LN may function as an inherent self-protective element during social interactions between consumers and the streamer in the live streaming shopping context. Managerial implications, limitations and suggestions for future research are also discussed at the conclusion of the paper.}

Further, this paper designs an incentive mechanism to attract consumers to participate in value co-creation under two live streaming sales modes and explores the impact of the incentive mechanism on live streaming sales mode selection. The results show that the brand chooses the traditional e-commerce mode when the total market size exceeds a certain threshold; otherwise, the brand can select the live streaming mode to create more value. Under the brand live streaming mode, providing incentive mechanisms to encourage consumer engagement in live streaming is beneficial for achieving value co-creation when the incentive level is below a certain threshold. Under the influencer live streaming mode, the brand shares incentive costs with the influencer instead of being conducive to value addition, i.e., the incentive cost should be borne by the influencer rather than the brand.}

Based on the information foraging theory, we identify relevant search (i.e., attractiveness and perceived product fit) and evaluation (i.e., vividness, mutuality, and price value) cues and assess how they influence consumers’ continuous watching and purchase intention. A survey was conducted, and 486 Chinese consumers were recruited. Our results show that search and evaluation cues influence consumers’ search experience (i.e., perceived enjoyment, perceived serendipity, and perceived diagnosticity), which ultimately results in continuous watching and purchase intentions. In addition to structural equation modeling, we also conducted a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify multiple pathways leading to search experience, continuous watching and purchase intentions. Our study contributes to the literature by developing a theoretical model explaining the whole process of live-streaming shopping. Our study also emphasizes the vital role of broadcasters (compared to co-viewers) and highlights the importance of serendipity. The results from the fsQCA also provide important strategic suggestions for practitioners regarding how to promote products via live streaming.}

abstract = {To address the challenges posed by the emergence of live streaming (LS) channels and mitigate competition among different distribution channels, manufacturers are increasingly adopting quality-differentiated distribution strategies. In this study, we develop a model involving a manufacturer and an influencer to investigate the following two potential strategies: the HL strategy (where high-quality products are marketed via the LS channel while low-quality products are marketed via the traditional online channel) and the LH strategy (where low-quality products are marketed via the LS channel while high-quality products are marketed via the traditional online channel). Moreover, we categorize products into cost-driven and demand-driven types to explore the factors that influence a manufacturer's strategic choice of different types of products. Our key insights are as follows. First, manufacturers should focus on the following two factors: product type and influencer ability. When products belong to cost-driven category and the influencer possesses high ability, implementing the LH strategy can lead to a mutually beneficial outcome for both parties. Furthermore, when the influencer's ability is low, achieving a win‒win situation for both parties becomes unattainable, regardless of the type of product. Second, the pricing of low-quality products may not necessarily be lower than that of high-quality products. When products belong to demand-driven category and the influencer's ability is high, manufacturers can set a higher price point for low-quality products when selling them through the traditional online channel. Third, the influencer exhibits varying preferences for product quality when selling different types of products. When products belong to demand-driven category, the influencer prefers selling high-quality products. Conversely, for cost-driven products, the influencer favors low-quality products. If there is a mismatch between the manufacturer's strategy and the influencer's preference, then the influencer tends to minimize its losses by reducing its LS effort. Fourth, from the perspective of consumer surplus and social welfare, our analysis reveals that the HL strategy yields a higher level of consumer surplus and contributes more to social welfare for demand-driven products; but for cost-driven products, the LH strategy emerges as the more favorable choice.}

Despite this, there remains a significant gap in understanding how streaming behaviors and co-playing relationships impact streamer popularity. This study addresses this gap by utilizing a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 450 thousand streamers from January 2020 to April 2023. We demonstrate that features derived from streaming and co-playing behavior can effectively forecast both short- and long-term popularity, achieving an AUC of 0.93 to 0.99. Our analysis indicates that streamer popularity is significantly impacted by the average number of followers and viewers, as well as their strategic positioning within the co-playing network, notably the number of weakly connected components. These findings elucidate strategies for streamers to attract and retain followers, enhancing their presence within the community. This research is the first to explore the influence of the live streamer co-playing network on popularity dynamics, revealing how interactions among online content creators can drive popularity beyond individual behaviors. Moreover, the insights gained can assist brands and businesses in collaborating with streamers more effectively, maximizing their influence and creating mutual value.}

This study reveals the influence of product-based fit on impulse purchases through affective and cognitive systems from the match-up perspective. The results indicate that both streamer-product fit and self-product fit enhance affective intensity and reduce perceived product risk. Unexpectedly, live content-product fit increases perceived product risk but has no significant impact on affective intensity. In addition, both streamer-product fit and live content-product fit enhance consumer perception of self-product fit, which, in turn, influences perceived product risks and affective intensity. However, emotion but not cognition breeds impulse purchase intention. Our findings can offer guidance for online retailers on how to utilize live streaming technology to increase sales.}

However, the impact of consumers’ anticipated regret on decision-making within live streaming e-commerce remains insufficiently explored. This study introduces a novel analytical framework based on anticipated regret theory to analyze its effects on the live streaming supply chain. Demand functions for both retail and live streaming products are derived, and a game-theoretic framework incorporating both centralized and decentralized decision-making structures is developed, aiming to analyze the Manufacturer Self-operated (MSO) and Key Opinion Leader (KOL) live streaming models. To validate the proposed models, both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are conducted to explore the effects of anticipated regret on key operational variables, including pricing strategies, market demand, and firm profitability. Furthermore, a revenue-sharing contract is proposed that optimizes the performance of live streaming e-commerce supply chains by offering managerial insights into pricing strategies, live streaming tactics, and revenue allocation mechanisms, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of live streaming e-commerce. The results reveal three findings: (1) Consumers’ anticipated regret leads to reductions in retail, wholesale, and live prices. (2) Both live streaming service quality and KOL characteristic exhibits threshold effects on pricing and demand. (3) A properly designed revenue-sharing contract improves supply chain coordination and increases profit for both the manufacturer and retailer.}

We find that the existence of greenwashing generates a higher profit for the platform in the agency mode. In the resale mode, the existence of greenwashing generates a higher (lower) profit for the platform if the additional profit brought by blockchain is low (high) at a low or moderate cap. However, when the cap is high, the existence of greenwashing hurts the platform’s profit. Furthermore, considering the government’s decision, we find that the existence of greenwashing hurts (improves) the social welfare at a high (low) correlation coefficient between the carbon trading price and potential market demand.}

This study examines a supplier with limited capacity collaborating with a streamer to conduct live-stream sales. Using a game-theoretical approach, we analyze how capacity constraints affect a supplier’s decision to introduce live streaming through either direct or reselling channels. Our analysis reveals that a supplier is more likely to adopt a live-stream channel when the commission rate and consumers’ additional costs associated with the live-stream channel are relatively low, provided capacity is not severely limited. Interestingly, even with a reselling channel, a supplier may benefit from a live-stream channel when consumer costs are relatively high. Moreover, a supplier with moderate capacity can sustain a live-stream channel at higher consumer costs than a supplier with low capacity. The study also reveals that the introduction of a live-stream channel always increases consumer surplus but does not consistently improve social welfare unless capacity is relatively abundant. Suppliers using direct channels require greater capacity to enhance social welfare than those using reselling channels. Furthermore, these results are robust across various extensions of the model.}

Viewers of live streaming channels can interact with live streamers through various behaviors, such as sending virtual gifts and Danmaku. It is very critical to accurately model such viewers' behaviors, which reflect their interest, for recommending live streaming channels. However, existing studies on live streaming channel recommendation usually model viewers' interaction behaviors through traditional graphs where an edge only connects two nodes, which cannot capture interaction relationships between multi-viewers and multi-channels. In this study, we propose a novel approach to live streaming recommendation based on Viewers' Interaction Behavior Modeled by Hypergraphs (VIBM-Hyper). Specifically, VIBM-Hyper first constructs two hypergraphs to model viewers' interaction behaviors, including a channel-oriented behavior hypergraph and a viewer-oriented behavior hypergraph. Then, it employs a hypergraph convolution technique to learn the representations of viewers and live streaming channels, respectively, which are finally used to predict a viewer's preference for a certain live streaming channel. We analyzed viewers' multiple types of behaviors in live streaming channels and conducted empirical evaluation to investigate the effectiveness of VIBM-Hyper with two real-world datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate its superior performance in live streaming channel recommendation in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods.}

People are investing more time in live streaming, and stress relief is one of their main motivations. The purpose of this study is to explore the causal relationship between viewers' live streaming dependence and perceived stress. We surveyed college students using the Live Streaming Dependency Scale and the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale, and constructed a cross-lagged panel model with questionnaire data. The results showed that live streaming dependence could not alleviate viewers' perceived stress, but rather became a facilitator. As time progresses, perceived stress reduces viewers' live streaming dependence. The results of this study suggest that indulgence in live streaming is not an antidote to stress relief. Practical and effective professional support should be sought when experiencing stressful events.}

In this study, live-stream shopping is conceptualized as an information system, and a theoretical framework that is grounded in the information system success model (ISSM) is developed. We draw on semistructured focus group interviews to extend the ISSM to incorporate the dual-path chain mediating effects of perceived value, satisfaction, and trust, alongside the moderating effect of brand popularity. We then use SmartPLS software to test the proposed model by reference to survey data obtained from 330 Chinese live-stream shoppers. The results support all the hypothesized relationships, notably highlighting the negative moderating effect of brand popularity on the theoretical model proposed in this research. Necessary condition analysis (NCA) reveals that among the six independent variables investigated in this context, streamer persuasion quality has the greatest effect size. Additional analyses reveal that the weekly duration of live stream watching does not affect the relationships between the independent variables and perceived value; however, it does influence the interrelations among consumers’ psychological variables. The findings of this research suggest that firms can strategically design and manage live-stream shopping contexts from an information system perspective.

abstract = {This paper analytically investigates the channel choice problem and price discount strategy of a supply chain under the live-streaming context. In the existing literature of traditional e-commerce, it is assumed that a manufacturer sells through the retailer's reselling or agency selling format. As live-streaming services developed, firms leverage the influence of Internet celebrities and discount strategies in the live-streaming channel to attract new consumers who are never aware of the firms’ offerings. However, it is unclear that how the unique characteristics of live-streaming commerce affect the choice of selling formats and the optimal price discount strategy. We develop a game-theoretical model with two price schemes (i.e., committed price scheme and dynamic price scheme) where the decision-maker only decides on the live channel introduction in the first period. We first provide the thresholds at which decision-makers decide to adopt live-streaming selling. Second, we offer the optimal price discount rate and equilibrium outcomes for each selling format. The optimal price discount rate mainly depends on the uninformed consumers’ (UCs) valuation and informed consumers’ (ICs) proportion. Third, we solve the optimal selection of selling format for the retailer. The introduction of a live-streaming channel reduces the threshold that the retailer selects the agency selling format. Fourth, we compare the results of the committed price scheme and the dynamic price scheme. Findings show that decision-makers are more likely to offer a live channel promotion and raise the price of the traditional online channel under the dynamic price scheme. However, under the dynamic regular scheme, decision-makers tend to provide a deeper discount rate in the live channel, leading to a lower retail price in the live channel. Finally, we extend our model by considering a negotiated commission fee between the decision-maker and the third-party live streamer under different selling formats. Our study provides useful insights to managers to make the live-streaming channel adoption decision and make price discount decisions in supply chains with manufacturers selling through online retail.}

abstract = {In recent years, live streaming selling has experienced rapid growth, and become a widely adopted online sales way. The selection of products for live streaming is critical to attracting and retaining customers, thereby enhancing the reputation of live streaming rooms. However, given the frequent concerns about product quality in live streaming, a product selection approach that incorporates consumer preferences and the characteristics of live streaming room is essential. To address this challenge, this study introduces an AI-empowered large-scale group decision making (LSGDM) approach for live streaming product selection. Firstly, online reviews about live streaming products from e-commerce platforms, such as “JD.com” and “Taobao”, are collected by utilizing the Octopus crawler software. Then, a deep learning-based Universal Information Extraction with ERNIE (UIE-ERNIE) is firstly introduced to mine online reviews, which can automatically identify product attributes that consumers care about, and can clearly classify sentiments in the reviews. Furthermore, linguistic hesitant-Z-numbers (LHZNs) are employed to concisely represent evaluation information. Finally, an online reviews-driven case study is formulated to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. Compared with the LDA and TF-IDF, mining reviews by UIE-ERNIE offers higher accuracy and efficiency without complex preprocessing. Sensitivity analysis is performed to explore the effects of the number of experts, online reviews and consensus threshold for the decision process. Comparative analysis indicates that the LHZNs significantly improve consensus degree. Overall, this study proposes an AI-empowered approach for live streaming product selection, combining real customer online reviews with expert evaluations to support decision-making.}

abstract = {Live streaming (LS) has become a vital sales channel for brand owners. This study evaluates three LS strategies: self LS (S model), where the brand sells directly through its own account; influencer LS (I model), where products are sold via an influencer's account; and hybrid LS (C model), which combines both approaches. Our findings reveal that the choice of strategy is strongly influenced by the influencer's fan effect. A high fan effect favors the I model, followed by the C model, while a low fan effect favors the S model. As customer viewing costs increase (e.g., due to shorter streaming durations), sales prices rise in the C model but drop in the I model. However, the brand owner's profit increases in both I and C models. We also find that moderate reputation spillover benefits both the brand owner and the influencer, but the influencer may not always deliver maximum effort in the I model. Additionally, consumer welfare is always highest when the C channel is used, and consumer interests may not always align with those of the brand owner and influencer. In the extensions, we consider platform streaming algorithms and external competition, further enriching the research conclusions. This study offers guidance to brand owners in selecting LS strategies, highlighting the trade-offs between self-live streaming and influencer collaboration.}

However, the literature on this topic is fragmented, lacking a cohesive foundation that hampers theoretical and empirical advancement. To address this gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review on impulse buying behavior in the context of live streaming e-commerce. Only peer-reviewed articles published in journals indexed in Web of Science or Scopus were considered. Our review synthesizes relevant findings from prior research across publication outlets, methodologies, theoretical frameworks, research contexts, and analyzed factors. We adopt the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model as an organizing framework, highlighting the key factors influencing impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce. The findings indicate that most research has relied on a cross-sectional survey design, predominantly conducted in Chinese contexts. Many researchers have employed the S-O-R framework; however, various other theoretical approaches have also been considered, depending on the key element under study (e.g., viewer, streamer, platform, or content of live streaming). Additionally, our findings identify a range of antecedents analyzed as different types of stimuli (e.g., marketing, streamer, live streaming, and others) and organismic factors (cognitive, affective, cognitive-affective, and personal traits). Finally, we propose a research agenda to guide future work and advance the field.}

Despite its substantial growth potential, there is a dearth of research on user interaction with live-streaming commerce in the context of user experience (UX). To comprehend user engagement with this technology and explore avenues for UX enhancement, we devised a three-stage user study. First, we conducted a UX assessment of leading live commerce platforms, employing both a self-report questionnaire and eye tracking. This enabled us to ascertain users' perceptions of user interface (UI) and live-streaming commerce components as well as identify the most user-friendly UI design. Second, we examined frequent users' experiences via online focus group interviews (FGIs). Through these, we observed that users employ chat and reaction features to convey empathy, enjoy themselves, or obtain rewards, ultimately driving sustained engagement and interaction with live-streaming commerce. Finally, we evaluated the visual effects designed to boost interactivity and pleasurable experiences through the development of a live-streaming commerce prototype. We determined that visual effects encompassing serendipitous elements augment users’ enjoyable experiences considerably during live-streaming commerce. Our findings provide valuable insights for practitioners aiming to refine live-streaming commerce interfaces and components to enhance UX.}

Our work investigates a retailer’s optimal strategy for sharing demand information with a manufacturer who may collaborate with a streamer to build a live-streaming selling channel. The results indicate that the manufacturer’s live-streaming selling channel expansion via an influencer does not necessarily harm the retailer because the retailer can free ride on the market expansion due to the social influence of the streamer. We also provide a rationale for the widespread voluntary information sharing observed in the era of live-streaming selling. The retailer can discourage or encourage the manufacturer to establish a live-streaming channel by sharing the demand information, which depends on the streamer’s social influence. In addition, potential changes to the information sharing policy result in several unexpected profit implications for the manufacturer, whose profit exhibits a nonmonotonic relationship to the streamer’s social influence and the channel expansion cost. In other words, our results counterintuitively show that the manufacturer may suffer from cooperating with a highly influential streamer in a live-streaming channel but benefit from choosing a less influential one.}

To mitigate this issue, retailers can adopt blockchain technology for product traceability to enhance consumer trust, i.e., blockchain-traceable products may be sold in live streaming. Our paper presents three analytical models under various return policies to explore how live streaming and blockchain technology interact in e-commerce. Retailers can invest in live streaming with influencers to attract consumers and in blockchain technology to reduce product returns, benefiting from a demand-enhancing effect and a price-enhancing effect, respectively. The retailer’s investment strategy between live streaming and blockchain technology depends on the interactions of these two effects, moderated by the retailer’s budget type, the market commission level of live streaming, and the traceability cost of blockchain technology. For budget-constrained retailers, live streaming and blockchain technology act as substitutes. When the commission level is low (high) and the traceability cost is high (low), the demand-enhancing (price-enhancing) effect dominates the price-enhancing (demand-enhancing) effect, thus the retailer invests in live streaming (blockchain technology) as a substitute for blockchain technology (live streaming). Conversely, for budget-unconstrained retailers, they may act as complements, prompting investment in both when commission levels and traceability costs are low. The retailer does not invest in either when both the commission level and traceability cost are high. We extend our results to a full refund policy to show the robustness of our result and find that it reduces the retailer’s incentive to invest in live streaming or blockchain technology.}

Specifically, the live-streaming platform can not only exclusively promote products for brands on its own platform but also nonexclusively promote products for brands from traditional retail platforms (traditional platforms). In this paper, we distinguish the influence of consumer behavioral characteristics on demand between live-streaming and traditional platforms. By developing two game models, we investigate whether the live-streaming platform should promote products for brands nonexclusively. Counterintuitively, when the live-streaming platform adopts exclusive promotion, a higher live-streaming platform's commission rate may be beneficial to the brand on it. Equally surprisingly, with nonexclusive promotion strategy, the traditional platform benefits more with the live-streaming platform's promotional ability under certain conditions. If the promotion cost coefficient is sufficiently high, the live-streaming platform should choose the exclusive promotion strategy; otherwise, it may adopt the nonexclusive promotion strategy. We further obtain the conditions for live-streaming platforms and brands from traditional platforms to cooperate. That is, given the impacts of the promotion cost coefficient and live-streaming platform's commission rate, the solo win-win situation is the exclusive promotion strategy, while given the impacts of the promotion cost coefficient and promotion fee, a win-win situation occurs under both the exclusive and nonexclusive promotion strategies.}

Specifically, live-streaming's immediacy and interactivity might intensify ethical dilemmas, like intrusive marketing and lack of transparency, impacting consumer trust and brand loyalty. Initially, this study applies self-determination theory to explore how live streaming empowers consumers and affects brand interaction and decision-making, then investigates the impact of ethical issues on this process. Our findings suggest empowerment does not invariably result in high-quality relationships, particularly when consumer ethics diverge from brand behavior. Subsequently, we employ Hunt-Vitell's General Theory of Marketing Ethics for an in-depth analysis of how consumer perceived ethically mediate the empowerment-relationship quality link. Through three experiments, we confirm the impact of consumer empowerment on retention intentions and the mediating role of relationship quality, also showcasing the negative influence of consumers' ethical perceptions on the empowerment-relationship quality dynamic. This study offers fresh insights into consumer behavior within live-streaming contexts and furnishes empirical evidence for retailers to boost trust and engagement.}

To be specific, the study investigates the impact of viewers' real-time comments and streamer's dialogue on product sales and follower growth, using minute-level data for detailed analysis. The results show that real-time comments exhibit a nonlinear inverted U-shaped relationship with product sales and increment in followers. Such relationship indicates that the “overloaded comments” during live streams could cause a problem on live streaming commerce platforms. In addition, we find that streamer's dialogue has a positive effect on product sales and can mitigate the inverted U-shaped relationship between real-time comments and product sales. Furthermore, we identify that streamer's dialogue has a delayed effect on product sales, with sales typically occurring 2.5 to 5 min after the dialogue ends. The findings provide valuable guidance for optimizing the management of live streaming commerce platforms.}

The findings demonstrate that presence has the strongest influence, compared to perceived enjoyment and immersion on parasocial relationship. Moreover, parasocial relationship help cultivate consumers’ trust, with stronger effect of trust in the seller than trust in the product, leading to greater purchase intention.

The findings reveal that streamers' promotional speech was rich in interactional metadiscourse. Among stance resources, self-mentions and boosters were used frequently, whereas hedges and attitude markers were less common. Engagement markers mainly included audience references, followed by questions and directives, with minimal use of personal asides and shared knowledge. These metadiscourse resources contribute to parasocial interaction. Stance resources enhance source credibility by presenting streamers as expert and trustworthy product endorsers. Engagement resources foster mutual awareness by cultivating a sense of co-presence between streamers and reviewers in personalized interactions, while also enhancing homophily by highlighting perceived similarities between the two. Collectively, these interactional metadiscourse strategies create an interactive online shopping discourse, fostering a heightened level of parasocial interaction, in which viewers are drawn into in an illusionary, reciprocal communication and form imagined friendships with streamers in the digital space.}

In addressing the multimodal data associated with a diverse range of products, our framework improves the Transformer architecture to initially capture the intra-product modal features and subsequently integrate the inter-product features. Data experiments are conducted on a real-world dataset from Taobao Live. The framework outperforms both traditional machine learning methods and state-of-the-art multimodal fusion methods, which affirms its value as a robust decision-support tool for sales prediction, enabling more accurate pre-event predictions and strategic planning. We also examine the impact of different types of information in accurate sales prediction. It is found that harnessing a comprehensive suite of data leads to optimal performance across all evaluation metrics. Commodity-related data is primary factor in determining the prediction accuracy, followed by video data and streaming room-related data, providing insights regarding the resource allocation for collecting and analyzing multimodal data from live streaming platforms.}

As extensions of the literature, it focuses on live streaming features (rather than merely the influencer), the mediating effect of flow experience, and differences across live streaming genres. Analysis of data from 1233 Chinese live streaming users shows that interactivity, utility, and entertainment (but not harmony) stimulate the viewer's flow experience, which mediates their effects on monetary and non-monetary engagement behaviors. Contrary to intuition, since flow experiences require a balance of utility and entertainment, influencers need to emphasize utility in hedonic live streaming genres and entertainment in utilitarian genres. Utility is more important and interactivity is less important in high-involvement and hedonic genres. Regarding influencer characteristics, trustworthiness, expertise, and charisma positively influence the flow experience. As a contribution to the live streaming literature, this study explains how live streaming features can be optimized to improve customer engagement.}
