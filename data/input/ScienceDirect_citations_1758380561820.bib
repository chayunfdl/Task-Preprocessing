abstract = {One of the challenging problems in text processing is diacritics generation where one needs to generate diacritic marks for non-accented text. With an ever increasing amount of informal text without accents such as short text messages, emails or blog posts on social media, a software system which is capable of generating diacritic marks accurately is very useful and necessary in many situations. This paper presents an approach to improve the accuracy of diacritics generation for Vietnamese text. We propose two novel deep learning models which leverage a plausible conceptual representation for the phonetic structure of Vietnamese syllables. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our models achieve a significant improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art methods for diacritics generation. We also demonstrate that the proposed models can be applied efficiently to improve the accuracy of hate speech detection on Vietnamese social networks.}

Automating the analysis of these reviews is vital for efficient review management. While traditional machine learning (ML) models rely on basic word-based feature extraction, deep learning (DL) methods, enhanced with advanced word embeddings, have shown superior performance. This research introduces a novel aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) framework to classify app reviews based on key non-functional requirements, focusing on usability factors: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. We propose a hybrid DL model, combining BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) with BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) layers, to enhance classification accuracy. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art models demonstrates that our BERT-BiLSTM-CNN model achieves exceptional performance, with precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy of 96%, 87%, 91%, and 94%, respectively. The significant contributions of this work include a refined ABSA-based relabeling framework, the development of a high-performance classifier, and the comprehensive relabeling of the Instagram App Reviews dataset. These advancements provide valuable insights for software developers to enhance usability and drive user-centric application development.}

However, most existing research focuses on mining the context-word-to-aspect-word dependencies of dependency trees based on the sentence itself without using much text-related external knowledge. In addition, the problem of reasonably capturing words outside the multihop grammatical distance and edge label hinders the effect of GCN. This paper proposes a graph convolutional network that fuses external knowledge (sentiment lexicon and part-of-speech information) (EK-GCN). Specifically, we conduct a statistical study on part-of-speech and construct a part-of-speech matrix to fully consider the influence of denying words, degree words, and other words that affect sentiment expression in sentences on sentiment classification. Then, an external sentiment lexicon is used to assign sentiment scores to each word in the sentence to construct a sentiment score matrix to highlight the weight of sentiment words, which to a certain extent, compensates for the fact that the syntactic dependency tree cannot capture edge labels. In addition, we design a Word–Sentence Interaction Network (WSIN), which can fully consider the information of the current aspect word and interact with the context information of the reviews to filter useful sentence information. We conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets, and the excellent experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. The results also verify that fully integrating external knowledge can assist in completing aspect-based sentiment analysis tasks.}

Recent works demonstrate the usefulness of machine learning (ML) in dealing with the nuances required to distinguish between hateful posts from just sarcasm or offensive language. Many ML solutions for hate speech detection have been proposed by either changing how features are extracted from the text or the classification algorithm employed. However, most works consider only one type of feature extraction and classification algorithm. This work argues that a combination of multiple feature extraction techniques and different classification models is needed. We propose a framework to analyze the relationship between multiple feature extraction and classification techniques to understand how they complement each other. The framework is used to select a subset of complementary techniques to compose a robust multiple classifiers system (MCS) for hate speech detection. The experimental study considering four hate speech classification datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework is a promising methodology for analyzing and designing high-performing MCS for this task. MCS system obtained using the proposed framework significantly outperforms the combination of all models and the homogeneous and heterogeneous selection heuristics, demonstrating the importance of having a proper selection scheme.

Automatic hate speech detection on social media is becoming an outstanding concern in modern countries. Indeed, hate speech towards people brings about violent acts and social chaos; hence, law prohibits it, and it engenders moral and legal implications. It is crucial that we can precisely categorize hate speech and not hate speech automatically. This allows us to identify easily real people who represent a threat for our society. In this paper, the authors applied a complete text mining process and naïve bayes machine learning classification algorithm to two different data sets (tweets_Num1 and tweets_Num2) taken from Twitter to better classify tweets. The results obtained demonstrate that the model performed well regarding different metrics based on the confusion matrix including the accuracy metric, which achieved 87. 23% on the first dataset and 93. 06% on the second.}

Recently, several researchers have attempted to apply first-order logic (FOL) rules to deep neural networks via the posterior constraint method. However, existing methods simply apply a priori constraints to represent the FOL with coefficients selected by hand, which requires improvements in incorporating and adapting abstract knowledge in data. In this study, we propose a novel logic tensor network with massive rules (LTNMR) for aspect-based sentiment analysis, which is constructed by incorporating FOL. Specifically, we integrate two types of knowledge into the logic tensor network: (1) dependency knowledge, which improves the efficiency of the capture of aspect-related words and (2) the human-defined knowledge rule, which helps the classifier understand the sentiment of the extracted aspect-related words. Furthermore, to achieve high inferring accuracy, we propose a mutual distillation structure knowledge injection (MDSKI) strategy. MDSKI transfers dependency knowledge from teacher Bert to LTNMR, which acts as the student network. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed LTNMR, combined with the MDSKI strategy, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art results for aspect-based sentiment analysis.}

In this study, we have computed the hate speech sub-model, the racism sub-model, and the hate speech and racism co-existence model equilibrium points and analyzed their stabilities, using the next generation operator approach all the models' effective reproduction numbers are computed, examined the phenomenon of backward bifurcation whenever the model effective reproduction number is less than one where at which both the positive co-existence free equilibrium point and the positive co-existence dominance equilibrium point exist simultaneously. To achieve the objective minimizing the hate speech and racism co-existence dissemination dynamics by implementing the efforts towards the protection and improvement (rehabilitation) strategies, the optimal control problem is re-formulated, and optimal control analysis is performed for the co-existence model using Pontryagin's maximum principle. Numerical simulations using MATLAB ode45 solver with fourth-order Runge-Kutta numerical methods to investigate the behavior of the co-existence model solutions and to explore the optimal effects of the protections and improvements (rehabilitation) strategies for the hate speech and racism co-existence dynamics are then performed. From the results, we observed that implementing the protection and improvement (rehabilitation) strategies simultaneously is the most effective approach to minimize and tackle the speech and racism co-existence propagation in the community.}

Despite many successful applications of sentiment analysis (SA) in these domains, the range of semantic techniques employed is still limited and predominantly focused on the detection of sentiment at a coarse-grained level. This paper proposes a novel methodology for Fine-Grained Aspect-based Sentiment (FiGAS) analysis. The aim is to identify the sentiment associated with specific topics of interest in each sentence of a document and to assign real-valued polarity scores between -1 and +1 to those topics. The proposed approach is unsupervised and customised to the economic and financial domains by using a specialised lexicon provided by us along with the FiGAS source code. Our lexicon-based SA approach relies on a detailed set of semantic polarity rules that allow understanding of the origin of sentiment – in the spirit of the recent trend on Interpretable AI. We provide an in-depth comparison of the performance of the FiGAS algorithm with other popular lexicon-based SA approaches in predicting a humanly annotated dataset in the economic and financial domains. Our results indicate that FiGAS statistically outperforms the other methods by providing a sentiment score that is closer to those of human annotators.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to conduct fine-grained sentiment analysis, necessitating the extraction of three key components: target entity, aspect category and sentiment polarity. These three components collectively form an integrated ABSA task known as TASD (Target-Aspect-Sentiment jointly Detection). Most of existing approaches on ABSA usually employ Recurrent neural networks(RNNs), Convolutional neural networks(CNNs) or pre-training models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT). However, they have some common weaknesses. First, most of the existing methods focus on one or two sub-tasks instead of triplet detection, thus they do not establish an end-to-end (training a complex learning system represented by a single model) ABSA model and cannot utilize the relevance of multiple ABSA sub-tasks during training. Second, they cannot achieve accuracy and efficiency simultaneously due to the coupling of context and given aspects. Third, they are poor in recognizing implicit targets. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel method named the Twin Towers End to End model (TTEE) to solve TASD task. It transforms complex TASD task into a simple end-to-end multi-task framework, simultaneously conducting target and aspect-sentiment detection. It builds twin towers system based on BERT or its updated versions to decouple context and given aspects, which can reduce redundant calculation to improve computational efficiency significantly. It offers great advantage to identify implicit target entity and its associated aspect-sentiment in the context without introducing extra model architecture. Experiments on three public datasets in different domains demonstrate that our approach not only achieves better performance on various evaluation metrics, but also has high efficiency in both training and inference phases, over a wide range of sample size and number of aspect categories.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) deals with understanding sentiments about specific attributes. Aspect term extraction (ATE) plays an essential role in aspect sentiment classification (ASC) by specifying the main aspects for sentiment accuracy. This paper introduces a dual-task framework for ATE and ASC models in which, the ATE model uses the imbalanced maximized-area under the curve proximate support vector machine (ImAUC-PSVM) method to mitigate the imbalance problem and the output of ATE serves as the reward in the training process of ASC supported by RL (reinforcement learning). The ImAUC-PSVM uses the conventional PSVM (proximate support vector machine) strength for sentiment tasks and the AUC (area under the curve) optimization for imbalance addressing. The ASC model employs multiple kernels for word embedding, with a transductive long short-term memory (TLSTM) for sentence representation that considers samples near the test point for better model refinement. The policy of the RL-based training strategy of the ASC model is represented by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) that categorizes sentences into positive, negative and neutral sentiments. In this RL context, aspect terms serve as rewards in the training process. The scope loss function (SLF) is also integrated within RL to rectify dataset imbalances. To optimize ATE and ASC models, an artificial bee colony (ABC) technique is incorporated for hyperparameter optimization. Experiments and evaluations conducted on English (Restaurant and Laptop) and Hindi datasets show the superiority of the proposed model over existing models of the literature. Moreover, transfer learning (TL) is applied to a Twitter dataset to assess its effect on ATE. The F-measures of the ATE model are obtained as 90.12 and 84.10 and the accuracies of the ASC model are calculated as 84.10 and 82.02 on Restaurant and Laptop datasets, respectively.}

To appraise various algorithms’ relevance, this chapter contrasts both legal and societal norms afforded people doing business face-to-face in private spaces with those engaged online in anonymous enterprises. The spate of legal and sociological texts that arose to address issues related to unfettered free speech online have identified eight unintended consequences (the contagion of hate, self-censorship, online harassment, cybersexism, revenge porn, trolling, hate reading, and radicalization). This chapter next explores recently developed software tools that could potentially deter hate speech and then analyzes how self-learning AI could grasp empathy, which is central to applying more complicated ethical schemes. Imagining that this opportunity could work, this chapter evaluates how victims of unfettered online free speech might have fared under corrective algorithms that deployed either Kant’s moral maxim, utilitarianism, libertarianism, Rawls’ “worst-off fares best” scheme, or human rights. This chapter thus gauges which of these models best augments individual security and protects privacy. Just as ethical review boards determine medical research boundaries in order to protect human subjects and improve data collection/analyses, this chapter proposes that ethical review boards be established to assess the consequences of social media algorithms.}

Our study makes three main contributions: (1) we developed a new dataset with span-level annotations for homophobia and transphobia in Tamil, English, and Marathi; (2) we employed advanced language models using BERT-based architectures, Conditional Random Field (CRF), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layers to enhance span-level detection of harmful content; and (3) we conducted benchmarking to evaluate the effectiveness of monolingual and multilingual models in detecting subtle forms of hate speech. The annotated dataset, which is collected from real-world social media (YouTube) content, provides diverse language contexts and enhances the representation of low-resource languages. The span-based detection approach enables models to detect subtle linguistic nuances, leading to more precise content moderation that accounts for cultural differences. The experimental results show that our models achieve effective span detection, which provides valuable information for creating inclusive moderation tools.

More recently, effects of syntax-based models, applying graph convolution operation over dependency trees, are highlighted due to their superiority. However, these methods still have deficiencies. For one thing, little aspect-specific information is considered during semantic modeling of contextual words, which introduces irrelevant noise toward the aspect. For another, current syntax-based approaches either ignore the syntactic constituent knowledge, or fail to maintain the syntactic information from the reconstructed constituent tree. As such, no relation among words, phrases and clauses is built. In this work, a Semantic Enhanced Bi-Syntax Graph Convolutional Network (SEBS-GCN) is proposed to enhance semantics of context to the aspect, and capture the sentiment relevance among words, phrases and clauses. Specifically, we devise an aspect-aware gated mechanism to obtain the aspect-aware feature, based on the semantic correlations between the specific aspect and its contexts. Furthermore, the syntax information of the constituent tree is sufficiently exploited to analyze the hierarchical structure and the logical relation among words, phrases and clauses, based on which to capture the sentiment clues of the aspect.}

Sentiment analysis (SA) models are mostly used to evaluate the conveyed sentiments by patients in these narratives to assess positive or negative clinical outcomes or to judge the impact of a drug or a medical condition. To date, many state-of-the-art SA models often result in false assessment coverage due to the natural medical entities recognition deficiency and ambiguity problem. In this work, we propose a semisupervised-based neural sense disambiguation approach that helps to substantially define ambiguities, their levels, and the relational mappings between biomedical targets and dependencies for accurate aspect-based sentiment prediction. Three main modules are proposed: (1) generate a sentiment value based on extracted concepts and their synsets, (2) encode the representations of the contextual senses and sentiment inputs, and (3) estimate an aspect-based sentiment weight based on the context-dependency sentiment units vs. the biomedical sense. Both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation proved how the proposed method have succeeded in pruning contextual sense feature generation and showed a strong agreement for biomedical data property parameterization and ambiguity type extraction. Thus, the model offers a significant rate of discrimination of biomedical natural concept senses by critically analysing constraints from conjunctions of positive or negative contextual semantics. A total of 21% of the vocabulary is drug names, 11% is a multiword drug reaction expressions, 7% is disease symptoms, and 5% is disease-related concepts such as symptoms and related therapy terms. Furthermore, the experiments on a multisource data from Twitter and health-related forums have overshadowed sentiment assessment and achieved an accuracy of 0.91 regarding concepts-based biomedical aspects. These results provide fresh insights into how to investigate biomedical knowledge, e.g., Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and PubMed, to clarify the correspondence of various biomedical descriptive entities, definitions, and data properties from shared medication-related content.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a kind of fine-grained task that predicts sentiment polarities for the given aspects in a sentence. Recently, graph-based methods such as graph convolutional networks (GCNs), graph attention networks (GATs) and their extensions have been used to model the syntactic structures of sentences and have achieved promising results. However, these graph-based methods generally homogenize dependencies and result in the loss of syntactic information. In addition, models that use only syntax-based graph methods are unable to identify the sentiments in informal reviews. In this study, we propose a dependency feature-aware hierarchical dual-graph convolutional network (HD-GCN) model, which consists of two specifically designed GCNs for extracting syntactic and semantic information. Specifically, for semantic information extraction, we leverage a self-attention matrix to represent the correlations between nodes. For syntactic information, we design a dependency feature-aware GCN that adaptively learns the mappings of various dependencies in the adjacency matrix. Moreover, we stack the network into multiple layers, and each layer learns different relation matrices to better obtain different levels of linguistic features. Extensive experiments are conducted on the SemEval 2014 and Twitter datasets, and the obtained experimental results are superior to those of the state-of-the-art models on the ABSA task, proving the effectiveness of our model.}

As a consequence, performance claims of the current state-of-the-art have become significantly overestimated. The problems that we have found are mostly related to data overfitting and sampling issues. We discuss the implications for current research and re-conduct experiments to give a more accurate picture of the current state-of-the art methods.

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to predict the sentiment polarity towards given aspects in a sentence. Recent research has highlighted that graph neural networks based on syntactic dependency trees effectively convey rich syntactic information and are suitable for ABSA tasks. Most existing work typically adopt either dependency type or minimum distance between nodes in the original syntactic tree to construct different views. However, existing work overlooks the high-dimensional local feature information in dependency relations, resulting in inadequate exploration of this view. Meanwhile, most work ignores that the minimum distance view and the dependency view can be complementary and integrated in syntactic analysis. Unfortunately, directly adding the two views introduces noise issues, leading to unsatisfactory results after their integration. To address these issues, this paper introduces an integrating dual syntactic views graph convolutional network (IDSV-GCN) model that seamlessly integrates dependency type view and minimum distance view, enabling comprehensive utilization of syntactic structure and information. To better address the computation of weights in the dependency type view, we innovatively propose a fusion attention mechanism. This approach effectively captures both global and local feature information. To more effectively integrate the two views and reduce the impact of noise, we employ a syntactic mask layer to filter out noise in the dependency type view and highlighting important dependency feature information. Then, we construct a minimum distance weight matrix based on the matrix obtained from the dependency type view. Finally, we merge the two matrices and feed them into the GCN to facilitate the model’s learning of syntactic information. Experimental results on three widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed IDSV-GCN model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.}

Dependency tree-based graph convolutional network models (GCN) have been widely applied in ABSA. These studies utilize syntactic analysis tools to derive syntactic dependency graphs, which are then inputted into GCN. It enables iterative learning of sentiment dependency information from contextual words to aspect terms. However, directly using syntactic dependency graphs can lead to two shortcomings. First, the long-distance sentiment information in long sentences will be weakened during GCN iterative computations. Second, the syntactic dependency graphs of short sentences lack sentiment strength information. To address these two shortcomings, we propose a Distance-Reconstructed Dependency Enhanced Sentiment analysis approach with Sentiment Strength based on GCN (DRD-SE-GCN) approach, in which the syntactic dependency graph of long sentences is reconstructed based on distance, thus narrowing the gap between sentiment words and target aspect words. It ensures that the sentiment dependency information carried by the long-distance sentiment words will not be weakened or lost during the GCN iteration. Additionally, the weights of the syntactic dependency graph for short sentences are reassigned so as to carry the strength information of sentiment words. Experimental results on four standard datasets show that our proposed model can effectively improve the accuracy of aspect-level sentiment analysis.}

In this paper, we propose an Aesthetic-oriented Multiple Granularities Fusion Network for JMASA, termed Atlantis. This trident-shaped framework comprises three branches: Textual-vision Alignment Aspect-sentiment Extraction, Sentiment-aware Image Aesthetic Assessment, and Aesthetic-aware JMASA. Notably, the first two branches function as auxiliary learning tasks, with Textual-vision Alignment Aspect-sentiment Extraction aimed at bridging the representational gap between modalities, and Sentiment-aware Image Aesthetic Assessment dedicated to understanding the aesthetic attributes of images. Concurrently, the Aesthetic-aware JMASA dynamically integrates varied granular features from both branches to perform JMASA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first aesthetic-oriented approach in the present field. Experimental results on two public datasets verify that Atlantis outperforms a series of prior strong methodologies and achieves a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. The enhancement highlights Atlantis’s advanced capability in accurately identifying aspect-sentiment pairs with aesthetic features.}

abstract = {Background:
The supplier selection problem is a sophisticated decision-making process that involves evaluating multiple factors. While previous research has primarily focused on objective attributes, such as supplier qualifications, product quality, and price, the subjective opinions of users have often been overlooked. However, with the growing importance of user reviews and sentiment analysis in e-commerce, incorporating users’ opinions on supplier products can provide valuable insights.
Purpose:
This study aims to address the limitations of existing supplier selection approaches by proposing a comprehensive framework that integrates aspect-level sentiment analysis and a fuzzy multi-attribute decision model. The goal is to enhance the decision-making process by considering both objective attributes and subjective opinions.
Methods:
To achieve this, we develop a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model with a gating mechanism to perform aspect-level sentiment analysis. Furthermore, we propose a fuzzy multi-attribute decision model that combines the predefined sentiment aspects with traditional evaluation criteria. The model is applied to a dataset specifically designed for automotive component supplier selection.
Results:
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing methods and datasets. A case study demonstrates the combination of aspect-level sentiment analysis and the fuzzy decision model allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of suppliers.
Conclusion:
By integrating aspect-level sentiment analysis and the fuzzy multi-attribute decision model, our proposed framework offers a novel perspective on supplier selection problems. The results highlight the feasibility and superiority of our approach, providing valuable insights for management in making informed decisions. This research contributes to the fields of supplier selection, sentiment analysis, and decision-making, with potential applications in various industries beyond the automotive sector.}

However, most existing methods tend to focus on extracting visual features from only one facet, such as face expression, which ignores the value of information from other key facets, such as the textual information presented by the image modality, resulting in information loss. To overcome the aforementioned constraint, we put forth a novel approach designated as Multi-faceted Information Extraction and Cross-mixture Fusion (MIECF) for Multimodal Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis. Our approach captures more comprehensive visual information in the image and integrates these local and global key features from multiple facets. Local features, such as facial expressions and textual features, provide direct and rich emotional cues. By contrast, the global feature often reflects the overall emotional atmosphere and context. To enhance the visual representation, we designed a Cross-mixture Fusion method to integrate this local and global multimodal information. In particular, the method establishes semantic relationships between local and global features to eliminate ambiguity brought by single-facet information and achieve more accurate contextual understanding, providing a richer and more precise manner for sentiment analysis. The experimental findings indicate that our proposed approach achieves a leading level of performance, resulting in an Accuracy of 79.65 % on the Twitter-2015 dataset, and Macro-F1 scores of 75.90 % and 73.11 % for the Twitter-2015 and Twitter-2017 datasets, respectively.}

Automated methods of hate speech detection typically employ state-of-the-art deep learning (DL)-based text classifiers—large pretrained neural language models of over 100 million parameters, adapting these models to the task of hate speech detection using relevant labeled datasets. Unfortunately, there are only a few public labeled datasets of limited size that are available for this purpose. We make several contributions with high potential for advancing this state of affairs. We present HyperNetworks for hate speech detection, a special class of DL networks whose weights are regulated by a small-scale auxiliary network. These architectures operate at character-level, as opposed to word or subword-level, and are several orders of magnitude smaller compared to the popular DL classifiers. We further show that training hate detection classifiers using additional large amounts of automatically generated examples is beneficial in general, yet this practice especially boosts the performance of the proposed HyperNetworks. We report the results of extensive experiments, assessing the performance of multiple neural architectures on hate detection using five public datasets. The assessed methods include the pretrained language models of BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, MobileBERT and CharBERT, a variant of BERT that incorporates character alongside subword embeddings. In addition to the traditional setup of within-dataset evaluation, we perform cross-dataset evaluation experiments, testing the generalization of the various models in conditions of data shift. Our results show that the proposed HyperNetworks achieve performance that is competitive, and better in some cases, than these pretrained language models, while being smaller by orders of magnitude.}

Exploiting dependency syntactic information with graph neural networks has recently become a popular trend. Despite their success, methods that rely heavily on a dependency tree face major challenges. This concerns the alignment of aspects and their word sentiments due to the richness of the language and the fact that a dependency tree might produce noisy signals from unrelated associations. This paper introduces a Dual-Relational Graph Attention Network (DRGAT) that fully exploits syntactic structural information and then the sentiment-aware context (e.g., phrase segmentation and hierarchical structure) of the constituent tree of a sentence. Additional constituency and dependency attention mechanisms provide comprehensive syntactic information across words, thereby enabling an accurate connection between aspect words and corresponding sentiment words. Considering that the original parsed constituency tree may have a large depth, this could lead to words being far apart increasing the computational overhead. The constituency tree of each sentence is dynamically reconstructed by determining the importance of each relational node. Extensive experimental results on six English datasets demonstrated that fully exploiting syntactic information can achieve excellent sentiment classification results.}

Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are open platforms where people can express their feelings, thoughts, and emotions. This can lead to a variety of opinions—can collide and lead to verbal conflicts. Therefore, it’s necessary to make social media sites safe by identifying and eliminating hate speech. Any statement that disparages an individual or a group based on a trait such as race, color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or another attribute is referred to as hate speeches. Several countries or group of countries such as India, USA, France, Canada, European Unions, and several others have created code of conduct to ensure that social media platforms must regulate any kind of hateful speech, which can disturb the normal functioning of our society and mitigate the risk of any unrest by using social media as a platform. In recent years, we have several examples where fake as well as hate speech on social media has created chaos in real life. Therefore, there is a strict need for an automated methodology to automatically detect and remove hate speech, which can lead to the disturbance in our society. The automated methodology should also be able to provide the clear reason why the specific sentence or the word was detected as hate speech. In this chapter, we will implement a Deep Learning algorithm, that is, Long Short Term Memory to identify hate speech from Twitter speech data, we will be using preprocessing techniques such as Bag of Words, Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency, and Glove word embedding by implementing Tensorflow data Pipeline. After training these models, we will compare these models, and based on the metric, we will select all the trained models and implement XAI Explainable Artificial Intelligence known as Local Interpretable Model–Agnostic Explanation to unravel the selected model to understand why the black-box model is associating the datapoint with the specific class.

Background
A link between weather and aggression in the offline world has been established across a variety of societal settings. Simultaneously, the rapid digitalisation of nearly every aspect of everyday life has led to a high frequency of interpersonal conflicts online. Hate speech online has become a prevalent problem that has been shown to aggravate mental health conditions, especially among young people and marginalised groups. We examine the effect of temperature on the occurrence of hate speech on the social media platform Twitter and interpret the results in the context of the interlinkage between climate change, human behaviour, and mental health.
Methods
In this quantitative empirical study, we used a supervised machine learning approach to identify hate speech in a dataset containing around 4 billion geolocated tweets from 773 cities across the USA between May 1, 2014 and May 1, 2020. We statistically evaluated the changes in daily hate tweets against changes in local temperature, isolating the temperature influence from confounding factors using binned panel-regression models.
Findings
The prevalence of hate tweets was lowest at moderate temperatures (12 to 21°C) and marked increases in the number of hate tweets were observed at hotter and colder temperatures, reaching up to 12·5% (95% CI 8·0–16·5) for cold temperature extremes (–6 to –3°C) and up to 22·0% (95% CI 20·5–23·5) for hot temperature extremes (42 to 45°C). Outside of the moderate temperature range, the hate tweets also increased as a proportion of total tweeting activity. The quasi-quadratic shape of the temperature–hate tweet curve was robust across varying climate zones, income quartiles, religious and political beliefs, and both city-level and state-level aggregations. However, temperature ranges with the lowest prevalence of hate tweets were centred around the local temperature mean and the magnitude of the increases in hate tweets for hot and cold temperatures varied across the climate zones.
Interpretation
Our results highlight hate speech online as a potential channel through which temperature alters interpersonal conflict and societal aggression. We provide empirical evidence that hot and cold temperatures can aggravate aggressive tendencies online. The prevalence of the results across climatic and socioeconomic subgroups points to limitations in the ability of humans to adapt to temperature extremes.

abstract = {Nowadays, due to the great uncontrolled content posted daily on the Web, there has also been a huge increase in the dissemination of hate speech worldwide. Social media, blogs and community forums are examples where people are freely allowed to communicate. However, freedom of expression is not always respectful since offensive or insulting language is sometimes used. Social media companies often rely on users and content moderators to report on this type of content. Nevertheless, due to the large amount of content generated every day on the Web, automatic systems based on Natural Language Processing techniques are required for identifying abusive language online. To date, most of the systems developed to combat this problem are mainly focused on English content, but this issue is a worldwide concern and therefore other languages such as Spanish are involved. In this paper, we address the task of Spanish hate speech identification on social media and provide a deeper understanding of the capabilities of new techniques based on machine learning. In particular, we compare the performance of Deep Learning methods with recently pre-trained language models based on Transfer Learning as well as with traditional machine learning models. Our main contribution is the achievement of promising results in Spanish by applying multilingual and monolingual pre-trained language models such as BERT, XLM and BETO.}

However, sentiment knowledge is used to create static features, which cannot be propagated over an entire corpus. Unlike previous researchers, we designed a corpus-level sentiment knowledge fusion mechanism with storage, update, and sharing functions, which can help the model to better understand the sentiment information of various opinion words in the dataset. Specifically, we first constructed a dependency graph for each sentence and refined the weights of the edges by the relative distance between the aspect terms and context words. We then introduced two special sentiment knowledge nodes in the graph to establish connections with opinion words by leveraging external sentiment lexicons. We set these two nodes to be globally shared and updatable, which allowed the model to learn corpus-level and domain-specific sentiment knowledge. This knowledge can help the model to generate a better aspect representation that contains rich contextual information and sentiment knowledge. Extensive experiments were conducted on several public datasets, and the experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. We also analyzed the performance gains from using learned corpus-level sentiment knowledge to transfer across different datasets.}

Particularly, the employment of generative models to address the Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment (ACOS) quadruple extraction task has emerged as a prominent research focus. However, existing studies have not thoroughly explored the inherent connections among sentiment elements, which could potentially enhance the extraction capabilities of the model. To this end, we propose a novel Generative Model with a Grid Tagging Matching auxiliary task, dubbed as GM-GTM. First, to fully harness the logical interaction flourishing within sentiment elements, a newly output template is designed for generative extraction task, which conforms to causality and human intuition. Besides, we technically introduce a grid tagging matching auxiliary task. Specifically, a grid tagging matrix is designed, in which various tags are defined to represent different relationships among sentiment elements. In this way, a comprehensive understanding of the relationships among sentiment elements is obtained. Consequently, the model’s reasoning ability is enhanced, enabling it to make more informed inferences regarding new sentiment elements based on existing ones. Extensive experimental results on ACOS datasets demonstrated the superior performance of our model compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.}

The key to this task is to utilize the relationship between sentiment words and aspect words. The mainstream methods use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Attention mechanisms, or Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to explore the syntactic information. Though these methods are undoubtedly effective, they still encounter several challenges: (1) Since most of the studies used only syntactic dependency graphs, they lacked a more optimal representation of inter-word relationships. (2) Some studies have explored multiple relationship graphs, but they fail to effectively integrate syntactic dependencies with semantic or other information, thereby impeding the exchange of multiple information elements. Moreover, the inclusion of more information graphs increases the computational burden on the model. In this paper, we construct a word-level relational hypergraph containing various syntactic and semantic relationships between aspect words and other context words. We propose an aspect-specific hypergraph attention network (ASHGAT) to thoroughly investigate the hypergraph’s information. Furthermore, we design an aspect-oriented syntactic distance-based weight distribution mechanism to optimize hypergraph attention. We conducted extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets from SemEval 14, 15, and 16. The results show that ASHGAT demonstrates the other SOTA baselines.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to mine multiple sentiment–target pairs contained in a review sentence. The main challenge of this task is how to extract the sentiment polarity of a specific sentiment item efficiently. Earlier research focused on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which implicitly associate the sentiment items with sentiment polarities through an attention mechanism. However, due to the complexity of language and the fact that a sentence contains multiple sentiment pairs, these models often fail to capture sentiment pairs accurately. Most recent efforts have applied syntactic information, especially dependency information, to construct structured models (e.g., tree-based models or graph neural networks) for sentiment analysis. Although these structured models achieve better results, they ignore the domain knowledge related to the entities of the comment sentences. This domain knowledge (e.g., brand reputation, influence) significantly impacts the sentiment polarity. Hence, this paper proposes a Knowledge-aware Dependency Graph Network (KDGN) based on the dependency graph incorporating domain knowledge, dependency labels, and syntax path. Experimental results on the benchmarking datasets demonstrate that our KDGN significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on the ABSA task, further illustrating that the domain knowledge, dependency labels, and syntax path are crucial for the ABSA task.}

Twitter has become a dynamic space where individuals share views, opinions, and sentiments on various topics, including significant political events such as elections. The 2024 Presidential Election in Indonesia is a good moment to represents public sentiment. The study aims to the explore sentiment expression on social media, considering diverse perspectives, language nuances, and specific cultural contexts within the Indonesian political landscape. To determine sentence sentiment, both standard sentiment analysis and ABSA are considered, with a preference for ABSA due to its ability to identify aspects within a sentence and provide more detailed sentiment analysis. Therefore, this research proposes a solution by applying a BERT-based deep learning model. The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics, including confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. Comparative assessments are made with machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine. The results indicate that, with a 50:50 aspect ratio, BERT, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine achieve comparable accuracies. However, when the aspect ratio shifts to 60:40, BERT outperforms other models. Notably, in scenarios with a larger amount of training data, Support Vector Machine demonstrates slightly superior performance in predicting sentiment from Twitter data.}

Previous methods have limitations, such as over-reliance on syntactic trees ignoring semantic and global information, and difficulty in solving long-distance dependency problems. In response to these issues, this article puts forward a hybrid graph convolutional network (GCN) called SVCCL-GCN, which combines an improved variational autoencoder (VAE) and a contrastive learning module. First, construct dependency graph structures using syntactic dependency trees to obtain explicit syntactic dependency information. Then, a VAE module based on the self-attention mechanism is devised to acquire both global and local information of the data, and it is beneficial for capturing the explicit associations between aspect terms and relevant contexts to solve the long-distance dependency problems. Finally, so as to stimulate the model's capacity to flexibly learn comprehensive semantic information and emotional feature information between different words, a contrastive learning loss based on the capsule network is constructed by taking the output of the capsule network as the contrastive feature for unsupervised contrastive learning. The extensive experimental findings on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SVCCL-GCN productively improves the accuracy in distinguishing sentiment polarity.

It should be noted that the reported findings were obtained without the use of any ensemble techniques, thereby adhering to a model of effective and production-ready NLP.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained text classification task, and the cutting-edge ABSA models have achieved outstanding performance. Unfortunately, the robustness of these ABSA models is neglected. ABSA models must face numerous challenges to be robust, and we concentrate on one of these challenges caused by negation words, such as “not”, “un-”. In the actual context, these negation words intuitively result in two problems: negative sensitivity and spurious correlation. First, a negation word tends to reverse the sentiment polarity of a sentence. Meanwhile, in the ABSA datasets, most sentences containing negation words express Negative polarities, which will lead the predictive model to learn the spurious correlation between negation words and polarities. To resolve these ambiguous issues, we are inspired by causal inference and propose a novel data augmentation framework, namely Pseudo Dense Counterfactual Augmentation (PDCaug) for ABSA. Specifically, we initialize a pseudo sequence and employ a multi-head multi-layer attention network to achieve counterfactual augmentation for a vanilla sentence in the hidden space. This pseudo sequence will be adversarially trained. PDCaug is a plug-and-play method for various ABSA models, so we evaluate it on discriminative models and generative prompt-based models. Our extensive experiments show that our PDCaug can significantly and consistently outperform several data augmentation methods and ABSA models.}

As a result, hate content is on the rise, necessitating practical visual caption analysis. Thus, the relationship between image and caption modalities is crucial in visual caption analysis. Contrarily, most methods combine features from the image and caption modalities using deep learning architectures with millions of parameters already trained without integrating a specialized attention module, resulting in less desirable outcomes. This paper suggests a novel multi-modal architecture for identifying hateful memetic information in response to the above observation. The proposed architecture contains a novel "multi-scale kernel attentive visual" (MSKAV) module that uses an efficient multi-branch structure to extract discriminative visual features. Additionally, MSKAV utilizes an adaptive receptive field using multi-scale kernels. MSKAV also incorporates a multi-directional visual attention module to highlight spatial regions of importance. The proposed model also contains a novel "knowledge distillation-based attentional caption" (KDAC) module. It uses a transformer-based self-attentive block to extract discriminative features from meme captions. Thorough experimentation on multi-modal hate speech benchmarks MultiOff, Hateful Memes, and MMHS150K datasets achieved accuracy scores of 0.6250, 0.8750, and 0.8078, respectively. It also reaches impressive AUC scores of 0.6557, 0.8363, and 0.7665 on the three datasets, respectively, beating SOTA multi-modal hate speech identification models.}

The traditional supervised models have achieved promising results with annotated datasets. However, their performance dramatically decreases in cross-domain aspect term extraction tasks. Existing cross-domain transfer learning methods face two common limitations: (1) these works directly inject linguistic features into language models, making it challenging to transfer linguistic knowledge to the target domain; (2) they rely on the fixed predefined prompts, which is time-consuming to construct the prompts for all potential aspect term spans. To address the limitations, we propose a soft prompt-based joint learning method for cross-domain aspect term extraction in this paper. Specifically, by incorporating external linguistic features, the proposed method learns domain-invariant representations between source and target domains via multiple objectives, which bridges the gap between domains with varied distributions of aspect terms. Furthermore, the proposed method interpolates a set of transferable soft prompts consisting of multiple learnable vectors that are beneficial to detect aspect terms in the target domain. Extensive experiments are conducted on two groups of datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for cross-domain aspect terms extraction.}

Previous studies have investigated consumer acceptance of EV adoption in specific countries using sentiment analysis. Various data analytics and machine learning techniques have been implemented in those studies. However, those studies predominantly rely on the traditional sentiment analysis method, which assigns a single sentiment classification to each document or sentence.

Keeping the balance between freedom of speech and respecting each other dignity is a major concern of social media platform regulators. Although, automatic detection of offensive content using deep learning approaches seems to provide encouraging results, training deep learning-based models requires large amounts of high-quality labeled data, which is often missing. In this regard, we present in this paper a new deep learning-based method that fuses a Back Translation method, and a Paraphrasing technique for data augmentation. Our pipeline investigates different word-embedding-based architectures for classification of hate speech. The back translation technique relies on an encoder–decoder architecture pre-trained on a large corpus and mostly used for machine translation. In addition, paraphrasing exploits the transformer model and the mixture of experts to generate diverse paraphrases. Finally, LSTM, and CNN are compared to seek enhanced classification results. We evaluate our proposal on five publicly available datasets; namely, AskFm corpus, Formspring dataset, Warner and Waseem dataset, Olid, and Wikipedia toxic comments dataset. The performance of the proposal together with comparison to some related state-of-art results demonstrate the effectiveness and soundness of our proposal.}

Increased attention is being paid to the corporate human rights due diligence (HRDD) responsibilities applicable to online platforms countering illegal online content, such as hate speech. At the European Union (EU) level, cross-sector initiatives regulate the rights of marginalised groups and establish HRDD responsibilities for online platforms to expeditiously identify, prevent, mitigate, remedy and remove online hate speech. These initiatives include the Digital Services Act, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, the proposed Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence, the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act and the Code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online. Nevertheless, the HRDD framework applicable to online hate speech has focused mostly on the platforms’ responsibilities throughout the course of their operations - guidance regarding HRDD requirements concerning the regulation of hate speech in the platforms’ Terms of Service (ToS) is missing. This paper employs a conceptualisation of criminal hate speech as explained in the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers’ Recommendation CM/Rec(2022)16, Paragraph 11, to develop specific HRDD responsibilities. We argue that online platforms should, as part of emerging preventive HRDD responsibilities within Europe, respect the rights of historically oppressed communities by aligning their ToS with the conceptualisation of criminal hate speech in European human rights standards.}

abstract = {Deep learning techniques have dominated the literature on aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, deep models generally suffer from spurious correlations between input features and output labels, which significantly hurts the robustness and generalization capability. In this paper, we propose to reduce spurious correlations for ABSA, via a novel Contrastive Variational Information Bottleneck framework (called CVIB). The proposed CVIB framework is composed of an original network and a self-pruned network, and these two networks are optimized simultaneously via contrastive learning. Concretely, we employ the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) principle to learn an informative and compressed network (self-pruned network) from the original network, which discards the superfluous patterns or spurious correlations between input features and prediction labels. Then, self-pruning contrastive learning is devised to pull together semantically similar positive pairs and push away dissimilar pairs, where the representations of the anchor learned by the original and self-pruned networks respectively are regarded as a positive pair while the representations of two different sentences within a mini-batch are treated as a negative pair. To verify the effectiveness of our CVIB method, we conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark ABSA datasets. The experimental results show that our approach achieves better performance than the strong competitors in terms of overall prediction performance, robustness, and generalization.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a subtask of sentiment classification, and the difficulty is how to capture the sentiment aspect and sentiment polarity pairs in a sentence. Early studies applied serialization models with attention mechanisms to mine sentiment information. These models are simple and effective, but cannot accurately capture sentiment pairs when encountering complex sentences. Recently, scholars have applied dependency information to construct various graph neural networks for the ABSA task. Compared with serialized models, these structured models demonstrate the graph neural network is powerful in capturing information, and further illustrates the syntactic information is effective for sentiment analysis. However, these syntactic models are usually influenced by syntactic parsers, especially for complex sentences. Hence, this paper builds a Lexicon and Syntax Enhanced Opinion Induction Tree for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (LSOIT). Specifically, inducing knowledge-aware opinion induction trees for each aspect word applied by reinforcement learning and attention mechanisms that integrate the lexicon knowledge (i.e. sememe knowledge) and syntax knowledge (i.e. phrase structures, and dependency relationships). Finally, we establish graph neural networks on knowledge-aware opinion induction tree for ABSA. Experimental results on four benchmarking datasets (i.e., Rest14, Laptop14, Twitter and MAMS) demonstrate that LSOIT significantly improves 2.21%, 0.47%, and 0.18% on Rest14, Laptop14, and MAMS comparing with state-of-the-art models, respectively. Ablation Study and Case Study manifest that external knowledge is useful, especially for datasets with standardized grammar rules.}

abstract = {Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) involves determining sentiment polarity in sentences concerning specific aspects. Recent approaches in ABSA have incorporated dependency parsing to gain a deeper understanding of word associations within aspect-related terms. Nevertheless, these models typically concentrate solely on dependency connections while neglecting their specific characteristics or types. This can lead to sentiment inconsistencies, particularly when analyzing sentences with multiple aspects and diverse polarities. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative solution known as Aspect-specific Parsimonious Segmentation via Attention-based Graph Convolutional Network (APSA-GCN) for ABSA. Our model consists of two key modules that harness a variety of features, including syntax, semantics, and lexicon-based representations. The aspect-specific parsimonious segmentation framework segments the data and directs it to parsimonious dual filters, retaining only aspect-specific sentences called explicit data for lexicon-based representation. Subsequently, the Attention-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is employed to extract syntactic and semantic features more explicitly, thereby enriching the representation of aspect-related features. Extensive experiments were conducted on various benchmark datasets, and the results confirm the model’s efficacy as our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our introduced APS framework can be effortlessly incorporated into other benchmark models to enhance the outcomes of ABSA.}

abstract = {Most aspect-based sentiment analysis approaches at this stage primarily focus on extracting information from the comment sentence and analyzing the interaction between the comment sentence and aspect words while ignoring the importance of key phrase information. Sentences are composed of words and phrases following specific grammatical rules, and mining phrase information can provide valuable insights into short-distance collocations between words. Thus, integrating multi-granularities (sentences, phrases, and aspect words) in the learning process can lead to better vector representations. This paper proposes a multi-granularity information mining and sentiment hint model (MGSH). Specifically, we first use two phrase extraction techniques to separately extract a set of key phrases from comment sentences and use heuristic algorithms to merge and eliminate the redundancy of the two sets. In addition, we design a constrained multi-granularity fusion module to dynamically integrate information from different granularities, encouraging the model to capture semantic associations among these granularities. Finally, we conducted a statistical analysis on the number of aspect words in the comment sentences. We found a potential correlation between the overall emotion of the sentence and the aspect words. Therefore, we pre-assign sentiment pseudo-labels to the commented sentences to identify sentiment cues specific to aspects and potential sentiment relationships between sentences and aspects. Our experimental evaluations, conducted on three benchmark datasets, showcase the importance of multi-granularity information mining and interaction as well as the effectiveness of utilizing sentiment cue information.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) endeavours predict the sentiment polarity of specific aspects of a given review. Recently, prompt tuning has been widely explored and has achieved remarkable success in improving semantic comprehension in several NLP tasks. However, most existing methods consider semantic tuning for various tasks and overlook domain knowledge, such as common-sense background knowledge. This not only limits the model’s ability to understand and apply domain knowledge but also often leads to the model’s inability to fully utilise domain-specific information, resulting in poor semantic quality and inferior model performance. To bridge this gap, we conducted a systematic study of Prompt Tuning with Domain Knowledge (PTDK) for ABSA, which aimed to design efficient prompts that guide the model to learn the knowledge of specific aspects in ABSA. Specifically, we first fine-tune the Large Language Models (LLMs) using hard prompts, which enhance the ability to extract enriched domain insights from the knowledge base. Additionally, we employed a Co-occurrence Gate to meticulously filter and refine the domain knowledge. This mechanism enhances the domain representation capability of the prompt template by selecting the most similar parts that are independently generated from a vast amount of domain knowledge for each comment. Simultaneously, a emphhybrid prompt templatewas constructed. This template integrates hard prompts and trainable soft prompts to compensate for the lack of specificity in hard prompts and to facilitate the integration of specific masks in various domain vectors. This hybrid strategy further enhances our ability to utilise domain-specific knowledge when performing ABSA. Experimental results on three public datasets – Restaurant, Laptop, and Twitter – demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art baselines in all cases. The accuracies were 88.63%, 82.65%, and 81.65%, respectively, and F1-scores were 83.38%, 79.68%, and 80.36%, respectively. This translates into an average increase in accuracy of 0.97% and an enhancement in the F1-score of 1.03%. These enhancements not only validate the efficacy of our approach but also have substantial practical implications for real-world scenarios that require sophisticated sentiment analysis, such as the evaluation of customer feedback on e-commerce platforms.}

To resolve this task, ABSA training samples must be annotated with aspect words and the corresponding sentiment polarities. However, collecting such fine-grained training samples is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore the available ABSA training samples are often scarce. To break the data scarcity challenge of ABSA, we investigate semi-supervised aspect-based sentiment analysis (SemiABSA), which trains ABSA models using a limited amount of expensive labeled sentences and more unlabeled-yet-cheaper sentences. We propose a novel SemiABSA framework, namely semi-supervised aspect-based sentiment analysis with masked aspect prediction (S3 map), built on the self-training paradigm. We form pseudo-aspect words and pseudo-sentiment polarities for unlabeled sentences and improve model training. Specifically, a BERT-encoder-based masked aspect prediction (MAP) task achieves the pseudo-aspect words generation. Based on S3 map, we thoroughly investigate the potential of SemiABSA from various perspectives. The empirical results show that S3 map can consistently improve performance by leveraging unlabeled sentences, even those from different domains.}

However, such settings are neither practical nor appropriate in real-life applications, as aspects must be extracted prior to sentiment classification. This study aims to overcome this shortcoming by jointly identifying aspect terms and the corresponding sentiments using a multi-task learning approach based on a unified tagging scheme. The proposed model uses the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to produce the input representations, followed by a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layer for further contextual and semantic coding. An attention layer is added on top of BiGRU to force the model to focus on the important parts of the sentence. Finally, a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) layer is used to handle inter-label dependencies. Experiments conducted on a reference Arabic hotel dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the baseline and related work models.}

However, this approach is insensitive to syntactic structural information and susceptible to noise interference. Existing fusion methods are unable to effectively capture the complementary relationships between information, leading to large and less efficient model structures. To tackle these issues, we introduce a unique and original scheme that fuses semantic information, ConceptNet conceptual knowledge, and SenticNet affective knowledge, intending to improve the capability of the model to capture sentence features. Specifically, the process involves four steps: first, a semantic attention mechanism is constructed as the first channel to parse the semantic relationship within the context; second, the expressive meaning of the aspects is enhanced with concept mapping as the second channel, with concepts injected into aspectual words; third, the representation ability of sentence dependency graphs is strengthened through adding the affective knowledge of SenticNet as a third channel. Subsequently, the sensitivity of the model to affective information is increased, and finally, the optimization of aspect and context coordination is strengthened by integrating an interactive attention mechanism. The overall findings underscore the efficacy of the model, showing accuracy improvements of 1.05 % and 2.80 % on the Twitter and Lap14 datasets, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art models. Moreover the macro-F1 scores showed significant improvements of 1.99 % and 1.61 %, respectively, enabling more effective capturing of aspect-specific sentiment expressions.}

In this paper, we present and compare two commonly used contrastive learning approaches for enhancing ABSA performance: sentiment-based supervised contrastive learning and augmentation-based unsupervised contrastive learning. Sentiment-based supervised contrastive learning employs sentiment labels to distinguish between positive and negative samples. Augmentation-based unsupervised contrastive learning aims to utilize various data augmentation strategies to generate positive samples. Experimental results on three public ABSA datasets demonstrate that both contrastive learning methods significantly improve the performance of ABSA. Sentiment-based supervised contrastive learning outperforms augmentation-based unsupervised contrastive learning in terms of overall performance improvements. Furthermore, we conduct additional experiments to illustrate the effectiveness and generalizability of these two contrastive learning approaches.

While many proposed methods in this domain involve analyzing the impact on results by filtering out specific features. Although these methods can provide explanations, they often overlook a relevant factor: the deletion of features alters the structural information of the text, resulting in the loss of relations between features, thus leading to explanations that are not comprehensive and appropriate. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel feature attribution method known as General Explainable Sentiment Classification (GESC). Unlike traditional approaches that delete features, GESC focuses on preserving the inherent relations by substituting the features with synonyms. Furthermore, the GESC method employs the binary tumbleweed algorithm (BTA) to identify the optimal feature combination. Moreover, designers have created an adaptive iterative technique to accommodate texts of varying lengths. The application of GESC to aspect-based sentiment classification demonstrates its practicability. The experimental results indicate that the BTA primarily improves the efficiency of finding the optimal combination of features compared with other algorithms. The GESC method provides more compelling explanations than conventional feature attribution approaches.}

The sentiment of text sequences is analyzed by deep neural networks and attained noteworthy results. Conversely, these models also have some problems with the limitation of past-training word embeddings and lack of communication between the context and the particular characteristic of the attention scheme. The main part of this task is to develop the novel ABSA concerning both explicit and implicit aspects using demonetization dataset reviews from India. Initially, the pre-processing of online tweets is performed by stop word removal, tokenization, lower case conversion, and stemming. Further, the explicit aspects are extracted, as it is simple to extract from the sentence and the polarity score is computed. A machine learning algorithm termed as Neural Network (NN) is utilized that helps for training the data regarding the implicit aspects, and further, helps to differentiate properly for the testing data with exact polarity score. Optimal feature selection is performed using the Self Adaptive Beetle Swarm Optimization (SA-BSO). These optimal features are given to a deep structured architecture called Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with hidden neuron optimization by SA-BSO, which categorizes the demonetization reviews into positive, negative, or neutral. While taking the findings, the accuracy of the offered SA-BSO-RNN is secured at 4.67%, 6.56%, 3.54%, and 7.12% progressed than PSO-RNN, FF-RNN, CSA-RNN, and BSO-RNN, at 3-fold analysis for dataset 1.

Existing research in Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) frequently employs word embedding techniques for feature extraction, utilizing both Term and Transformer models. This study introduces an innovative approach by transitioning from word to sentence embedding, employing the SBERT transformer model for this transformation. This study further innovates label creation and topic modeling by integrating Bayesian search clustering with Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) calculations. This approach enables the identification of relevant topics, categorizing IDF scores based on occurrence frequencies. Scores ranging between 4–6 are marked as having low value but high informative potential, making them suitable candidates for label-specific datasets, particularly those without pre-existing labels.

Applying this comprehensive framework to hotel review datasets, the result of the ABSA evaluation achieved an impressive accuracy score of 99%, indicating the efficacy of the proposed methodology in this nuanced field.}

In recent years, exploiting semantic–syntactic information with graph neural networks has been widely used to address such tasks. However, such methods overlook the features of the location influence factor of words and may provide irrelevant or even interfering noisy signals for ABSA because of the word association relationships mined by the syntax tree and semantic composition tree. To alleviate the effect of noise information and fully strengthen the context for multiple-aspect representation in ABSA, we propose a new framework, PSA-GAT, that mines information on position importance, syntactic–semantic dependencies and cross-aspect correlations. Overall, the structural features of the multi-aspect sentiment set are learned by using various variations of graph neural networks. Moreover, the experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PSA-GAT compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Research on sentiment analysis of Indian regional language texts suffers due to the unavailability of available regional language datasets. The curated Malayalam Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) dataset is a labeled dataset for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) on the Indian regional language Malayalam over the movie review domain. Malayalam movie reviews, an excellent source of text data for ABSA, are collected from an online survey using Google form and manually collecting reviews from three social media platforms: IMDb, Facebook, and YouTube. Nine target aspects were identified, and three annotators annotated the dataset based on the sentiment polarity of each aspect. A total of 4000 reviews were collected, and a total of 7507 aspects are identified in the reviews. Spearman's correlation and Fleiss Kappa Index are used to analyze the annotated dataset's correlation. It has been found that the high correlation between the annotators implies that the MABSA dataset is of gold standard.}

Previous joint approaches have either viewed this task as collapsed label sequence annotation or modelled each subtask as a unified index sequence generation task, overlooking the explicit relation among its subtasks. This type of method cannot effectively integrate the strengths of task-specific models and adapt to difficult joint prediction tasks. To address this problem, we propose a Multi-model Co-guided Progressive Learning (MCPL) strategy that leverages task-specific models and the correlations among downstream tasks to expand high-quality training datasets, and provides progressive supervision signals to enhance the model’s ability to adapt from simple to difficult tasks. Based on MCPL, we construct a Phase-wise Progressive Learning (PPL) module for MABSA, in which three Task Affinity-based Pseudo-label Generation (TAPG) modules are proposed for task-specific label expansion. The TAPG modules leverage the task correlations among three MABSA downstream tasks for co-guided teaching, and the PPL module utilises their gradual relationship from aspect term extraction to perform sentiment classification and then joint prediction for progressive learning. Experiments on widely used public datasets demonstrate that the proposed MCPL method achieves excellent performance on the three subtasks of MABSA and outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.

Implications of the events, that take place in one corner of the word, reverberate across the globe in various geographies. This is so because the huge amount of data generated on these platforms, reaches the far corners of the world in the blink of an eye. Developers of these platforms are facing numerous challenges to keep cyber space as inclusive and healthy as possible. However, in recent years, the phenomena of offensive speech and hate speech have risen their ugly heads. Despite manual efforts, the scope of this problem is so immense that it cannot be tackled by using concerted teams. In fact, there is a need that an automated technique is designed that detects and removes offensive and hateful comments before the materialization of their harmful impacts. In this research work, we develop an Urdu language hate lexicon, on the basis of this lexicon we formulate annotated dataset of 10,526 Urdu tweets. Furthermore, as baseline experiments, we use various machine learning techniques for hate speech detection. In addition, we use transfer learning to exploit pre-trained FastText Urdu word embeddings and multi-lingual BERT embeddings for our task. Finally, we experiment with four different variants of BERT to exploit transfer learning, and we show that BERT, xlm-roberta and distil-Bert are able to achieve encouraging F1-scores of 0.68, 0.68 and 0.69 respectively, on our multi class classification task. All these models exhibited success to varying degree but outperform a number of deep learning and machine learning baseline models.}

abstract = {Background
Social media is a rich source where we can learn about people’s reactions to social issues. As COVID-19 has impacted people’s lives, it is essential to capture how people react to public health interventions and understand their concerns.
Objective
We aim to investigate people’s reactions and concerns about COVID-19 in North America, especially in Canada.
Methods
We analyzed COVID-19–related tweets using topic modeling and aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), and interpreted the results with public health experts. To generate insights on the effectiveness of specific public health interventions for COVID-19, we compared timelines of topics discussed with the timing of implementation of interventions, synergistically including information on people’s sentiment about COVID-19–related aspects in our analysis. In addition, to further investigate anti-Asian racism, we compared timelines of sentiments for Asians and Canadians.
Results
Topic modeling identified 20 topics, and public health experts provided interpretations of the topics based on top-ranked words and representative tweets for each topic. The interpretation and timeline analysis showed that the discovered topics and their trend are highly related to public health promotions and interventions such as physical distancing, border restrictions, handwashing, staying home, and face coverings. After training the data using ABSA with human-in-the-loop, we obtained 545 aspect terms (eg, “vaccines,” “economy,” and “masks”) and 60 opinion terms such as “infectious” (negative) and “professional” (positive), which were used for inference of sentiments of 20 key aspects selected by public health experts. The results showed negative sentiments related to the overall outbreak, misinformation and Asians, and positive sentiments related to physical distancing.
Conclusions
Analyses using natural language processing techniques with domain expert involvement can produce useful information for public health. This study is the first to analyze COVID-19–related tweets in Canada in comparison with tweets in the United States by using topic modeling and human-in-the-loop domain-specific ABSA. This kind of information could help public health agencies to understand public concerns as well as what public health messages are resonating in our populations who use Twitter, which can be helpful for public health agencies when designing a policy for new interventions.}

As a result, there is a growing need for automated systems capable of analyzing and interpreting this extensive content. In response, reputation generation systems have been developed to extract valuable insights from both textual and numerical reviews. However, many of these systems have significant limitations. Firstly, most of them are limited to processing English text, which poses a barrier for analyzing reviews in other languages. Also, they are incapable of handling immediate data influx, they often fall short in providing up-to-date and accurate reputation assessments. Therefore, we propose a two-phase system for generating accurate reputation values. In the first phase, data preparation, the system incorporates review translation to English, spam filtering, and sarcasm detection to address limitations of language processing and enhance data quality. This prepares the data for the second phase, reputation generation, which utilizes state-of-the-art, aspect-based sentiment analysis techniques, offering a novel approach to calculating reputation by considering specific aspects of products or services. Experimental results conducted on multiple datasets show the efficacy of the proposed system compared with previous reputation generation systems.}

This research includes an in-depth examination of previous efforts and strategies for detecting and preventing hateful content on the social network Twitter, as well as a novel classification approach based on users’ profiles, related social environment and generated tweets. This paper’s contribution is threefold: (i) an improvement in the performance of the HaterNet algorithm, an expert system developed in collaboration with the Spanish National Office Against Hate Crimes of the Spanish State Secretariat for Security (Ministry of the Interior) that is capable of identifying and monitoring the evolution of hate speech on Twitter using an LTSM + MLP neural network architecture. To that end, a model based on BERT, HaterBERT, has been created and tested using HaterNet’s public dataset, providing results that show a significant improvement; (ii) A methodology to create a user database in the form of a relational network to infer textual and centrality features. This contribution, SocialGraph, has been independently tested with various traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms, demonstrating its usefulness in spotting haters; (iii) a final model, SocialHaterBERT, that integrates the previous two approaches by analyzing features other than those inherent in the text. Experiment results reveal that this last contribution greatly improves outcomes, establishing a new field of study that transcends textual boundaries, paving the way for future research in coupled models from a diachronic and dynamic perspective.}

Comprehending multi-modal sentiment expression requires strong cross-modal alignment and fusion ability.

We present CoolNet (Cross-modal Fine-grained Alignment and Fusion Network) to boost the performance of visual-language models in seamlessly integrating vision and language information. Specifically, CoolNet starts by transforming an image into a textual caption and a graph structure, then dynamically aligns the semantic and syntactic information from both the input sentence and the generated caption, as well as models the object-level visual features. Finally, a cross-modal transformer is employed to fuse and model the inter-modality dynamics.This network boasts advanced cross-modal fine-grained alignment and fusion capabilities. On standard benchmarks such as Twitter-2015 and Twitter-2017, CoolNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithm FITE with notable improvements in accuracy and Macro-F1 values. Specifically, we observe an improvement in accuracy and Macro-F1 values by 1.43% and 1.38% for Twitter-2015, and 0.74% and 0.88% for Twitter-2017, respectively, demonstrating the superiority of our CoolNet architecture.}

The virtual edges are decided by the association intensity between the aspect and the words of the sentence. Instead of naively regarding all connecting edges as binary values, we design a novel GCN with a dual edge-embedding method to help information flow among each word in the sentence and between the aspect category and the sentence. Extensive experiments on two open datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in the aspect-target-sentiment triples detection task and its two subtasks.}

In this research, we introduce a novel Graph Augmentation Networks Based on Dynamic Sentiment Knowledge and Static External Knowledge Graphs (DSSK-GAN), which utilizes both dynamic and static external knowledge to aid in modeling the relationship between aspect words and their associated sentiment words. Specifically, DSSK-GAN is engineered to effectively capture and integrate information from three perspectives of representation (i.e., syntactic representation with dynamically updated sentiment nodes, semantic representation based on self-attention mechanism, and knowledge graph representation). Firstly, we have designed and developed the Bifold-GCN module, a two-channel graph encoder. A globally shared and dynamically updated sentiment enhancement matrix is used to feed the DS-SGCN to obtain the representation T1. The semantic representation T2 is produced by Sem-GCN using multi-head self-attention. Secondly, the knowledge graph embedding is concatenated with the output of Bi-LSTM to obtain the knowledge representation T3 using the aspect knowledge focus mechanism. Finally, we propose a local gating-global convolution module to fuse the representations of the three perspectives. Furthermore, we incorporate an extra mission for sentiment word categorization to enhance the model’s attention towards sentiment terms. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five publicly available ABSA datasets. The obtained findings demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed DSSK-GAN model.}

This study investigates customer satisfaction through aspect-level sentiment analysis and visual analytics. We collected and examined the flight reviews on TripAdvisor from January 2016 to August 2020 to gauge the impact of COVID-19 on passenger travel sentiment in several aspects. Till now, information systems, management, and tourism research have paid little attention to the use of deep learning and word embedding techniques, such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, especially for aspect-level sentiment analysis. This paper aims to identify perceived aspect-based sentiments and predict unrated sentiments for various categories to address this research gap. Ultimately, this study complements existing sentiment analysis methods and extends the use of data-driven and visual analytics approaches to better understand customer satisfaction in the airline industry and within the context of the COVID-19.

In this paper, we focus on the ability of graph convolution and propose an aggregated graph convolutional network (AGCN) to enhance the representation ability of target nodes. To exploit the node feature information, we introduce two aggregator functions to iteratively update the representation of each node from its local neighborhood. To extract more associated node information, we also apply the subdependency of nodes to aggregate the node features, and then employ the attention mechanism to capture the sentiment dependencies between different node feature information. The proposed AGCN is evaluated on large Chinese and English datasets to prove the effect of our model in aspect-based sentiment analysis. The experimental results show that our model is valid compared with other GCN-based methods.}

Recent investigations have demonstrated the superior performance of graph convolutional neural network (GCN) on dependency parsing tree. However, these GCN-based models fail to take the given aspect into account when calculating the hidden node representation vector, as well as lack exploration of contextual commonsense knowledge. On the contrary, the gating mechanism enables the interaction of the context and the given aspect to enhance the impact of the given aspect on the context. Nevertheless, such interactions are frequently inadequate resulting in insufficient extraction of sentiment information. This paper proposes a dual-gated graph convolutional network via contextual affective knowledge (DGGCN) to address these issues. The core idea is to incorporate GCN into the gating mechanism to enhance GCN to fully aggregate node information while strengthening the concentration on the given aspect. Simultaneously, the incorporation of contextual affective knowledge into graph networks can refine the perception of affective features. Experimental findings on five benchmark datasets reveal that our proposed DGGCN surpasses state-of-the-art methods.}

Besides, some works focused on learning the dependency information or the external knowledge-enhanced dependency information separately, which lacked the exploitation of the mutual interaction between the normal dependency and knowledge-enhanced dependency. Therefore, we propose a novel ABSA method namely prompted representation joint contrastive learning enhanced graph convolutional networks (PRCL-GCN) to strengthen the robustness of the ABSA model. Specifically, to achieve the task-oriented contextual representation, we design the task-specific prompt template to guide the fine-tuning process of PLM in the ABSA task. And a biaffine attention mechanism is employed to further extract the essential sentiment feature from the prompted representation. Moreover, we introduce the syntax dependency graph as prior knowledge, and construct an affective syntactic dependency graph by injecting the affective knowledge from SenticNet into the graph. Then, we utilize the multi-layer GCNs to process the above two syntactic graphs independently, which aims to learn multi-granularity syntactic features. Subsequently, a novel designed attention variant is leveraged to integrate these syntax features with the guided contextual representation, separately. Eventually, through designing a Kullback–Leibler divergence-based contrastive learning to encourage the model’s learning, we improve the model’s accuracy in modeling contextual representation by integrating the designed dual-ways information. Extensive experiments are conducted on five benchmark datasets, and the outstanding experiment results validate the effectiveness of our proposed model.}

Concerns and reasons were analyzed based on countries using an aspect-based sentiment analysis using a sentiment classifier with the BERT architecture. In Africa and the Middle East, societal concerns are centered around the possibility of not accessing food and potential famine; other analyses conducted in these countries indicate that access to products such as bread, baby food, animal products (milk, cheese, etc.), pasta, and many other categories have become significantly challenging. A large portion of the world views the food security crisis caused by the war as potentially leading to economic problems and famine. Social media posts from Poland, especially, in Central and Eastern European countries are intensely focused on economic issues. The sentiment analysis studies show that the Black Sea Grain Initiative, aimed at securing food security between the two countries, increased positive sentiments globally by up to 24%. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to identify concerns stated at the societal level worldwide on food security and measure objectives by country. This study presents findings that can develop projections for assessing concerns reflected in society regarding food security and formulating alternative plans, contributing to many countries in this regard.}

The potential of the proposed metrics have been evaluated on two public datasets of tweets through comparisons with sentiment-aware opinions analysis and state-of-the-art metrics for polarization and echo chamber detection. The results reveal that topology-based metrics strictly depending on random walks over the individuals are not sufficient to fully depict the communities closeness on topics and their prevailing beliefs coming out from content analysis.}

abstract = {As a key task of fine-grained sentiment analysis, aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to analyse people’s opinions at the aspect level from user-generated texts. Various sub-tasks have been defined according to different scenarios, extracting aspect terms, opinion terms, and the corresponding sentiment. However, most existing studies merely focus on a specific sub-task or a subset of sub-tasks, having many complicated models designed and developed. This hinders the practical applications of aspect-based sentiment analysis. Therefore, some unified frameworks are proposed to handle all the subtasks, but most of them suffer from two limitations. First, the syntactic features are neglected, but such features have been proven effective for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Second, very few efficient mechanisms are developed to leverage important syntactic features, e.g., dependency relations, dependency relation types, and part-of-speech tags. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel unified framework to handle all defined sub-tasks for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Specifically, based on the graph convolutional network, a multi-layer semantic model is designed to capture the semantic relations between aspect and opinion terms. Moreover, a multi-layer syntax model is proposed to learn explicit dependency relations from different layers. To facilitate the sub-tasks, the learned semantic features are propagated to the syntax model with better semantic guidance to learn the syntactic representations comprehensively. Different from the conventional syntactic model, the proposed framework introduces two attention mechanisms. One is to model dependency relation and type, and the other is to encode part-of-speech tags for detecting aspect and opinion term boundaries. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed novel unified framework, and the experimental results on four groups of real-world datasets explicitly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over a range of baselines.}

This study used descriptive questionnaires from customers who visited Japanese gastropubs and analyzed them to determine the correct polarity. We used existing sentiment analysis methods to see if the questionnaire was not classified as the correct polarity (positive or negative). Consequently, we found that the whole sentence of the questionnaire was still not always able to judge the content and polarity correctly. Therefore, we conducted an aspect-based sentiment analysis, characterized by a polarity evaluation of certain words in a sentence, rather than a polarity evaluation of the whole sentence. Negative expressions were extracted from the text to determine what was negative. From each expression, it was possible to see what was explicitly unsatisfactory. The extracted expressions were also grouped as aspects belonging to the same group before examining them individually. Subsequently, the extracted expressions were grouped into aspects, resulting in the percentage of each aspect. The results were then used to suggest what could be improved for Japanese gastropubs.}

For implementing the ABSA, one way is to convert the original problem into a sentence semantic matching task, using pre-trained language models, such as BERT. However, for such a task, the intra- and inter-semantic relations among input sentence pairs are often not considered. Specifically, the semantic information and guidance of relations revealed in the labels, such as positive, negative and neutral, have not been completely exploited. To address this issue, we introduce a self-supervised sentence pair relation classification task and propose a model named Multi-level Semantic Relation-enhanced Learning Network (MSRL-Net) for ABSA. In MSRL-Net, after recasting the original ABSA task as a sentence semantic matching task, word dependency relations and word-sentence relations are utilized to enhance the word-level semantic representation for the sentence semantic matching task, while sentence semantic relations and sentence pairs relations are utilized to enhance the sentence-level semantic representation for sentence pair relation classification. Empirical experiments on SemEval 2014 Task 4, SemEval 2016 Task 5 and SentiHood show that MSRL-Net significantly outperforms other baselines such as BERT in terms of accuracy, Macro-F1 and AUC.}

abstract = {In the realm of natural language processing (NLP), aspect-based sentiment analysis plays a pivotal role. Recently, there has been a growing emphasis on techniques leveraging Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN). However, there are several challenges associated with current approaches: (1) Due to the inherent transitivity of CGN, training inevitably entails the acquisition of irrelevant semantic information. (2) Existing methodologies heavily depend on the dependency tree, neglecting to consider the contextual structure of the sentence. (3) Another limitation of the majority of methods is their failure to account for the interactions occurring between different aspects. In this study, we propose a Clause Graph Transformer Structure (CGT) to alleviate these limitations. Specifically, CGT comprises three modules. The preprocessing module extracts aspect clauses from each sentence by bi-directionally traversing the constituent tree, reducing reliance on syntax trees and extracting semantic information from the perspective of clauses. Additionally, we assert that a word’s vector direction signifies its underlying attitude in the semantic space, a feature often overlooked in recent research. Without the necessity for additional parameters, we introduce the Clause Attention encoder (CA-encoder) to the clause module to effectively capture the directed cross-correlation coefficient between the clause and the target aspect. To enhance the representation of the target component, we propose capturing the connections between various aspects. In the inter-aspect module, we intricately design a Balanced Attention encoder (BA-encoder) that forms an aspect sequence by navigating the extracted phrase tree. To effectively capture the emotion of implicit components, we introduce a Top-K Attention Graph Convolutional Network (KA-GCN). Our proposed method has showcased state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance through experiments conducted on four widely used datasets. Furthermore, our model demonstrates a significant improvement in the robustness of datasets subjected to disturbances.}

We conduct a number of experiments to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models when applied to the FABSA dataset.

These deep learning models are often seen as black boxes, meaning that they are inherently difficult to interpret. To improve deep learning models, it is crucial to understand their inner workings. We aim to interpret black box models by implementing model-agnostic local interpretation methods. Inspired by Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Local Rule-based Explanations (LORE) and combined with a Similarity-based Sampling (SS) method, we propose SS-LIME and SS-LORE, and use Anchor to explain two state-of-the-art ABSA deep learning models. The deep learning models build upon the Left-Center-Right separated neural network with Rotatory attention (LCR-Rot) model, extended by iterating multiple times over the rotatory attention mechanism (LCR-Rot-hop) and hierarchical attention and context-dependent word embeddings (LCR-Rot-hop++). We evaluate the proposed models in terms of fidelity, hit rate, and user interpretability using the SemEval 2016 dataset consisting of restaurant reviews for ternary sentiment classification. Results show that the LCR-Rot-hop and LCR-Rot-hop++ models are best explained by SS-LIME and SS-LORE, respectively. Furthermore, we conclude that the LCR-Rot-hop++ model can be better interpreted than the LCR-Rot-hop model.}

ABSA divides the overall review sentiment of each online review into five categories, namely location, tastiness, price, service, and atmosphere. By employing the machine learning–based conditional survival forest model, empirical results show that compared with overall review sentiment, aspect-based sentiment for various factors can improve the prediction performance of restaurant survival.

In general, the syntactic dependency and semantic information between aspects and their contexts are modeled using deep neural networks. However, most of the existing methods treat specific aspects in a sentence independently, while ignoring the sentiment relationships between multiple aspects. In this work, we propose an Aspect-Pair Supervised Contrastive Learning (APSCL) model to capture the latent relationships between multiple aspects in the sentiment subspace. Through experiments, we approve that in the embedding space, the representation discrepancy of aspect-pairs in the same relation category is narrowed while the embedding representation of aspect-pairs in different relation categories is pushed away. Then the aspect feature representation is enhanced through the relationship optimization between aspects. Furthermore, the relation categories between aspects are established in terms of the existing label attributes of aspects, and no additional corpus is needed. The extensive experiments on public datasets SemEval 2014 and MAMs show that the proposed framework APSCL is able to improve up to 2.29% on accuracy and 4.18% on F1 score over top-1 baseline models. Moreover, our framework can also be adapted to other benchmark models.}

ABSA focuses on unveiling the sentiment orientation associated with specific entities or attributes within textual data, resulting in a more precise depiction of intricate emotional nuances. However, due to the extensive range of applications for ABSA, certain domains face challenges such as constrained dataset sizes and the absence of exhaustive, high-quality corpora, leading to issues like few-shot learning and resource scarcity scenarios. To address the issue of limited training dataset sizes, one viable approach involves the utilization of text-based context generation to expand the dataset. In this study, we amalgamate Bert-based text generation with text filtering algorithms to formulate our model. Our model fully leverages contextual information using the Bert model, with a particular emphasis on the interrelationships between sentences. This approach effectively integrates the relationships between sentences and labels, resulting in the creation of an initial data augmentation corpus. Subsequently, filtering algorithms have been devised to enhance the quality of the initial augmentation corpus by eliminating low-quality generated data, ultimately yielding the final text-enhanced dataset. Experimental findings on the Semeval-2014 Laptop and Restaurant datasets demonstrate that the enhanced dataset enhances text quality and markedly boosts the performance of models for aspect-level sentiment classification.}

Most of current annotation procedures are aimed at achieving a high level of agreement in order to generate a high quality reference source. However, the annotation guidelines for subjective content may restrict the annotators’ freedom of decision making. Motivated by a moderate annotation agreement in offensive content datasets, we hypothesize that personalized approaches to offensive content identification should be in place. Thus, we propose two novel perspectives of perception: group-based and individual. Using demographics of annotators as well as embeddings of their previous decisions (annotated texts), we are able to train multimodal models (including transformer-based) adjusted to personal or community profiles. Based on the agreement of individuals and groups, we experimentally showed that annotator group agreeability strongly correlates with offensive content recognition quality. The proposed personalized approaches enabled us to create models adaptable to personal user beliefs rather than to agreed offensiveness understanding. Overall, our individualized approaches to offensive content classification outperform classic data-centric methods that generalize offensiveness perception and it refers to all six tested models. Additionally, we developed requirements for annotation procedures, personalization and content processing to make the solutions human-centered.}

In graded user reviews, the model must specifically forecast the user's review score after receiving the textual review. The purpose of this article is to present a predictive outline for aspect-based extraction and classification that can estimate the users' optimal travel destination. This impression helps travellers in a variety of ways, such as by recommending better locations that also include expensive destinations. The underlying classification algorithm's processing time is significantly impacted by more dimensions. The term “curse of dimensionality” is often used in statistics and machine learning to describe these issues. By projecting the high-dimensional input data into the low-dimensional subspace while roughly maintaining the distance between the data points with a higher probability, the Random Projection (RP) ensemble classifier decreases the complexity of multivariate data. Extract the crucial information from the reviews, then use Glove word vector representation to categorise the relevant emotions. Further, the article proposed Multinomial Logistic Regression (MNLR) with a Fuzzy Domain Ontology (FDO) algorithm for aspect-based sentiment analysis. More intricate aspects than just the products themselves impact how satisfied people are with tourist destinations. The most important factor in evaluating how convenient a tourist route will be is typically the weather. The combined form of predicted sentiment score, start ratings and environment factor has to be calculated to predict the travel destination based on the measurement of personalized search results. The simulation was processed in Python software. The presented work has utilized some performance measures to evaluate the classification model such as F1-score, Recall, Precision, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Cohen Score and Matthew Score. The accuracy with GloVe word vector representation was 90% and after the GloVe representation, the classification model accuracy was about 94%. The proposed strategy outperforms in terms of classification accuracy, according to simulated results and analyses of real-world data.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis refers to the task of determining the sentiment polarity associated with particular aspects mentioned in a sentence or document. Previous studies have used attention-based neural network models to connect aspect terms with context words, but these models often perform poorly due to limited interaction between aspect terms and opinion words. Furthermore, these models typically focus only on explicitly stated aspect objects, which can be overly restrictive in certain scenarios. Current sentiment analysis methods that rely on aspect categories also often fail to consider the implicit placement of aspect-category information within the context. While existing models may produce strong results, they often lack domain knowledge. To address these issues, this study proposes an Aspect-position and Entity-oriented Knowledge Convolutional Graph (APEKCG) consisting of two modules: the Aspect position-aware module (APA) and the Entity oriented Knowledge Dependency Convolutional Graph (EKDCG). The APA module is designed to integrate aspect-specific sentiment features for sentiment classification by incorporating information about aspect categories into different parts of the context. The EKDCG module incorporates entity-oriented knowledge, dependency labels, and syntactic path using a dependence graph. Experimental results on five benchmarks Natural Language Processing (NLP) datasets of the English language demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed APEKCG framework. Furthermore, the APEKCG outperformed previous state-of-the-art models with its accuracy, achieving 89.13%, 84.32%, 89.02%, 79.64%, and 90.22% on the MAMS, Laptop, Restaurant, AWARE, and SemEval-15&16 datasets, respectively.}

Most studies used binary classifiers for hate speech classification, but these classifiers cannot really capture other emotions that may overlap between positive or negative class. Hence, a probabilistic clustering model for hate speech classification in twitter was developed to tackle problems with hate speech classification. A metadata extractor was used to collect tweets containing hate speech keywords and a crowd-sourced experts was employed to label the collected hate tweets into two categories: hate speech and non-hate speech. Features representation was done with Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) model and enhanced with topics inferred by a Bayes classifier. A rule-based clustering method was used to automatically classify real-time tweets into the correct topic clusters. Fuzzy logic was then used for hate speech classification using semantic fuzzy rules and a score computation module. From the evaluation results, it was observed that the developed model performed better in hate speech detection with F1-sore of 0.9256 using a 5-fold cross validation. Similarly, the developed model for hate speech classification performed better with F1-score of 91.5 compared to related models. The developed model also indicates a more perfect test having an AUC of 0.9645, when compared to similar methods. The Paired Sample t-Test validated the efficiency of the developed model for hate speech classification.}

abstract = {Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a crucial natural language understanding (NLU) research field which aims to accurately recognize reviewers’ opinions on different aspects of products and services. Despite the prominence of recent ABSA applications, mainstream ABSA approaches inevitably rely on large-scale supervised corpora, and their final performances is susceptible to the quality of the training datasets. However, annotating sufficient data is labour intensive, which presents a significant barrier for generalizing a high-quality sentiment analysis model. Nonetheless, humans can make more accurate judgement based on their external background knowledge, such as factoid triples knowledge and event causality. Inspired by the investigations on external knowledge enhancement strategies in other popular NLP research, we propose a novel knowledge augmentation framework for ABSA, named the Oxford Dictionary descriptive knowledge-infused aspect-based sentiment analysis (DictABSA). Comprehensive experiments with many state-of-the-art approaches on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed DictABSA significantly outperforms previous mainstream ABSA methods. For instance, compared with the baselines, our BERT-based knowledge infusion strategy achieves a substantial 6.42% and 5.26% absolute accuracy gain when adopting BERT-SPC on SemEval2014 and ABSA-DeBERTa on ACLShortData, respectively. Furthermore, to effectively make use of dictionary knowledge we devise several alternative knowledge infusion strategies. Extensive experiments using different knowledge infused strategies further demonstrate that the proposed knowledge infusion strategies effectively enhance the sentiment polarity identification capability. The Python implementation of our DictABSA is publicly available at https://github.com/albert-jin/DictionaryFused-E2E-ABSA.}

abstract = {Sentiment classification tasks, such as emotion detection and sentiment analysis, are essential in modern natural language processing (NLP). Moreover, vector representation frameworks modeling semantic content underlie each state-of-the-art NLP algorithmic scheme. In sentiment classification, traditional methods often rely on such embedding vectors for semantic representation, yet they typically overlook the dynamic and sequential nature of emotions within textual data. In this work, we present a novel methodology that leverages the distributional patterns of emotions. An embedding framework that captures the inherent serial structure of emotional occurrences in text is introduced, modeling the interdependencies between emotion states as they unfold within a document. Our approach treats each sentence as an observation in a multivariate series of emotions, transforming the emotional flow of a text into a sequence of emotion strings. By applying distributional logic, emotion-based embeddings that represent both emotional and semantic information are derived. Through a comprehensive experimental framework, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these embeddings across various sentiment-related tasks, including emotion detection, irony identification, and hate speech classification, evaluated on multiple datasets. The results show that our distributional emotion embeddings significantly enhance the performance of sentiment classification models, offering improved generalization across diverse domains such as financial news and climate change discourse. Hence, this work highlights the potential of using distributional emotion embeddings to advance sentiment analysis, offering a more nuanced understanding of emotional language and its structured, context-dependent manifestations.}

abstract = {With the widespread use of social networks, blogs, forums and e-commerce web sites, the volume of user generated textual data is growing exponentially. User opinions in product reviews or in other textual data are crucial for manufacturers, retailers and providers of the products and services. Therefore, sentiment analysis and opinion mining have become important research areas. In user reviews mining, topic modeling based approaches and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are significant methods that are used in extracting product aspects in aspect based sentiment analysis. However, LDA cannot be directly applied on user reviews and on other short texts because of data sparsity problem and lack of co-occurrence patterns. Several studies have been published for the adaptation of LDA for short texts. In this study, a novel method for aspect based sentiment analysis, Sentence Segment LDA (SS-LDA) is proposed. SS-LDA is a novel adaptation of LDA algorithm for product aspect extraction. The experimental results reveal that SS-LDA is quite competitive in extracting products aspects.}

Social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter have contributed largely to the spread of rumors, conspiracy theories, hate, xenophobia, racism, and prejudice. To combat the spread of fake news, researchers around the world have and are still making considerable efforts to build and share COVID-19 related research articles, models, and datasets. This paper releases "AraCOVID19-MFH"1 a manually annotated multi-label Arabic COVID-19 fake news and hate speech detection dataset. Our dataset contains 10,828 Arabic tweets annotated with 10 different labels. The labels have been designed to consider some aspects relevant to the fact-checking task, such as the tweet’s check worthiness, positivity/negativity, and factuality. To confirm our annotated dataset’s practical utility, we used it to train and evaluate several classification models and reported the obtained results. Though the dataset is mainly designed for fake news detection, it can also be used for hate speech detection, opinion/news classification, dialect identification, and many other tasks.}

abstract = {Hate speech is a public statement that demonstrates resentment or provokes disturbance towards a person or group often based upon race, age, religion, sexual orientation, minority group, psychical disability, political belief, etc. Such an act is a leading cause of mental degeneration in individuals observed throughout the world. We have witnessed an upsurge in the spreading of hateful speech through videos in recent times due to increased social media usage. Researchers are working on this issue because it has become more frequent on several social media platforms, and it leads to low self-esteem and has significant negative impacts on human life. In this work, we focus on collecting data from such videos as nowadays people are sharing numerous videos of this negative nature on platforms like Facebook and YouTube. The audio data of these videos were then converted into text to build the dataset, and we applied some classifier models to our dataset. In this paper, we utilized a transfer learning Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model that gives state-of-the-art outcomes. More precisely, we fine-tuned our model based on transfer learning to evaluate BERT's capacity to capture hostile contexts inside YouTube videos. We examined Fine–Tuning BERT; with different learning rates and listed the outcomes. We train the BERT by freezing all the hyperparameters but with various random seeds to evaluate our suggested Fine-tuning approach. Compared to previous methodologies that used our dataset, our proposition fared better in terms of accuracy and execution time.}

abstract = {Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a modern and effective form of sentiment analysis that enables the extraction of highly representative features of source textual data. Recent solutions rely on models built upon Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) embeddings and large manually-tagged datasets. This implies that usage of such methods requires large amounts of gold-tagged domain-specific data and is vulnerable to data drifts, while not being able to recognize segmented and summarize more complex terms. We propose an open-domain generative method for ASTE based on Generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) with few-shot and fine-tuning strategies. This method has shown to be applicable for the task, with the models being capable of consistent structuring of the output triplet, simplification of the terms without losing meaningful information, as well as successful analysis of data from unknown domains. Resulting models was tested on mixed domain Russian-language automatically tagged data with thorough manual editing by means of a large language model (LLM) with a few-shot approach and English data, which was only automatically tagged. The developed models have shown to take advantage of the ability to perform learning in a few-shot way, allowing knowledge distillation from larger to cardinally smaller ones. Models have also been tested on summarizing of large amounts of reviews and have shown results comparable to enterprise grade solutions.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims at determining the sentiment polarity of the given aspect term in a sentence. Recently, graph convolution network (GCN) has been used in the ABSA task and obtained promising results. Despite the proliferation of the methods and their success, prevailing models based on GCN lack a powerful constraint mechanism for the message passing to aspect terms, introducing heavy noise during graph convolution. Further, they simply average the subword vectors from BERT to form word-level embeddings, failing to fully exploit the potentials of BERT. To overcome these downsides, a graph convolutional network with multiple weight mechanisms is proposed for aspect-based sentiment analysis in the paper. Specifically, a dynamic weight alignment mechanism is proposed to encourage our model to make full use of BERT. Then an aspect-aware weight mechanism is designed to control message propagation to aspect during graph convolution operation. Afterwards, an aspect-oriented loading layer is presented to further reduce adverse effects of words irrelevant with aspect term. Finally, the multi-head self attention is used to fuse high order semantic and syntax information. Hence, the model can obtain the premium aspect-specific representations for prediction. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art results compared to other models.}

abstract = {Hate speech is an increasingly important societal issue in the era of digital communication. Hateful expressions often make use of figurative language and, although they represent, in some sense, the dark side of language, they are also often prime examples of creative use of language. While hate speech is a global phenomenon, current studies on automatic hate speech detection are typically framed in a monolingual setting. In this work, we explore hate speech detection in low-resource languages by transferring knowledge from a resource-rich language, English, in a zero-shot learning fashion. We experiment with traditional and recent neural architectures, and propose two joint-learning models, using different multilingual language representations to transfer knowledge between pairs of languages. We also evaluate the impact of additional knowledge in our experiment, by incorporating information from a multilingual lexicon of abusive words. The results show that our joint-learning models achieve the best performance on most languages. However, a simple approach that uses machine translation and a pre-trained English language model achieves a robust performance. In contrast, Multilingual BERT fails to obtain a good performance in cross-lingual hate speech detection. We also experimentally found that the external knowledge from a multilingual abusive lexicon is able to improve the models’ performance, specifically in detecting the positive class. The results of our experimental evaluation highlight a number of challenges and issues in this particular task. One of the main challenges is related to the issue of current benchmarks for hate speech detection, in particular how bias related to the topical focus in the datasets influences the classification performance. The insufficient ability of current multilingual language models to transfer knowledge between languages in the specific hate speech detection task also remain an open problem. However, our experimental evaluation and our qualitative analysis show how the explicit integration of linguistic knowledge from a structured abusive language lexicon helps to alleviate this issue.}
