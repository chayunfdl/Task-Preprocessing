abstract = {Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to analyze health-related public discourse based on large-scale data, but questions remain regarding their ability to accurately detect different types of health sentiments. Especially, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention as a powerful technology, yet their accuracy and feasibility in capturing different opinions and perspectives on health issues are largely unexplored. Thus, this research examines how accurate the three prominent LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and LLAMA) are in detecting risk-promoting versus health-supporting sentiments across two critical public health topics: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and heated tobacco products (HTPs). Drawing on data from Facebook and Twitter, we curated multiple sets of messages supporting or opposing recommended health behaviors, supplemented with human annotations as the gold standard for sentiment classification. The findings indicate that all three LLMs generally demonstrate substantial accuracy in classifying risk-promoting and health-supporting sentiments, although notable discrepancies emerge by platform, health issue, and model type. Specifically, models often show higher accuracy for risk-promoting sentiment on Facebook, whereas health-supporting messages on Twitter are more accurately detected. An additional analysis also shows the challenges LLMs face in reliably detecting neutral messages. These results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and validating language models for public health analyses, particularly given potential biases in training data that may lead LLMs to overestimate or underestimate the prevalence of certain perspectives.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to explore the contraception content topics on the highly popular social media platform TikTok to understand this influential information source patients may bring into birth control counseling visits.
Study design
Utilizing a snapshot method, we collected the 100 most popular TikTok English-language videos for each of the eight contraception-specific search terms. We abstracted video content topics addressed and creator attributes. Two independent abstractors coded each video with high agreement, with a third coder adjudicating discrepancies.
Results
The final data set included 700 unique videos, with a total of 1.18 billion views, 131 million likes, 1.5 million comments, and 4.1 million shares. In these videos, the most common topics addressed were patient experience (n = 365, 52.1%) and logistics of use (n = 351, 50.1%). Health care professionals created only 19.3% of videos (n = 135), but these videos accounted for a larger portion of the total video views (41.3%). Health care professionals largely made educational videos (92.6%) compared to 22.5% of videos coded as educational videos when made by perceived non–health care professionals. A small number of prolific video creators developed the majority of videos made by health care professionals, with 91 (67.4%) made by six TikTok creators.
Conclusions
TikTok contains highly accessible contraception content, which garners high viewership, especially when created by health care providers. Clinicians should be aware of TikTok’s potential to influence patients prior to contraceptive counseling visits and recognize this platform as a public health instrument to disseminate contraceptive information to a key demographic.
Implications
Few previous studies have examined the presence and popularity of contraception content topics on TikTok; little is known about the health content on this highly popular platform. Providers should be aware of the contraceptive topics on TikTok for understanding both patient perceptions and the potential for health education through this media.}

The aim of this study is to determine the relationship of social media with loneliness and anger levels of adolescents living in Turkey.
Design and methods
This study used a cross-sectional descriptive design. Loneliness and anger were measured with “University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale” and “Adolescent Anger Rating Scale”. Data collection forms were prepared on Google Form and form’ link was sent to adolescents.
Results
A total of 1176 adolescents aged 13–18 years within four high schools were included. The results obtained show use of Facebook and duration of Facebook use of adolescents were not related to mean scores of loneliness. Adolescents with high duration of Instagram use was to be found that loneliness scores were statistically high, but anger scores were similar. Twitter users had lower loneliness mean scores and higher anger scores. TikTok use was not related with loneliness scores.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study found that high duration of Instagram use was associated with higher loneliness scores in adolescents, while Twitter users had lower loneliness scores and higher anger scores. The use of Facebook and TikTok did not significantly affect loneliness and anger levels.
Practice implications
This study suggest that pediatric nurses can play a significant role in promoting balanced social media use and healthy coping strategies to mitigate the negative impact of excessive social media use on adolescent mental health. Pediatric nurses can support adolescent emotional wellbeing and promote a healthier digital environment.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) represents a crucial field of natural language processing (NLP). It focuses on deriving detailed sentiment insights from textual content. Dialogue-level aspect-based sentiment quadruple extraction (DiaASQ) is specifically concerned with pinpointing target-aspect-opinion-emotion quadruples within conversations. DiaASQ is important in industries like e-commerce, social media analytics, and customer feedback. However, Current ABSA approaches predominantly focus on single-text scenarios, often overlooking the complexities involved in sentiment analysis within conversational contexts. To fill this gap, this paper presents the IFusionQuad model, which is specifically designed for the DiaASQ task. Our contributions include the innovative integration of CloBlock in ABSA, enhancing feature representation with context-aware weights. The InteractiveNet Fusion Module further advances dialogue understanding by aggregating dialogue-specific features such as threads, speakers, and replies. Components such as CloBlock, gating mechanism, and Biaffine attention effectively mitigate data noise issues, improving the relevance of feature extraction. Empirical evaluation on standard datasets demonstrates that the IFusionQuad model outperforms baseline methods, achieving substantial improvements in quadruple extraction. Specifically, our model shows a 6.59% increase in micro F1 and a 7.05% increase in identification F1 for Chinese datasets, and a 2.65% and 4.69% increase in micro F1 and identification F1, respectively, for English datasets. The results clearly demonstrate our IFusionQuad model’s efficacy, which consistently outperforms baseline models across all evaluation datasets on the DiaASQ task.}

With the widespread use of TikTok, patients increasingly seek medical information on this platform before presenting for medical evaluation3. This study aims to systematically assess the content on TikTok pertaining to endometriosis.
Design
Using the term “endometriosis” on 2/22/23, the top 50 TikTok videos were viewed by three independent raters. General characteristics, content categories6, and quality of the health information as determined by the DISCERN tool, were compiled. Adequate interrater reliability by weighted kappa supported use of majority rules methodology to norm reviewer results.
Setting
Online survey.
Patients or Participants
Three independent raters.
Interventions
None.
Measurements and Main Results
Of 50 videos, 72% were posted by lay people, 12% by doctors, 10% by organizations and 6% by other medical providers. Videos posted by lay people had 1.9-2.9x the views, likes, shares and comments compared to videos posted by doctors. 72% of the videos featured information about symptoms, 50% discussed management, 26% mentioned disease outcomes, 18% discussed diagnosis and 2% reported risk factors. Videos featuring a personal vignette (72%) had 4.8x the total views (60M vs. 12M), 7x the total likes (4.5M vs. 606K), 3.4x the total shares (33M vs. 9.6M), and 6.9x the total comments (44K vs. 9K) compared to videos without. Only 1 video posted by a medical doctor featured a personal story, compared to 34 of 36 videos posted by lay people. With regards to quality of information, content was relevant (3.0/5), and the aims and achievement of aims were considered high (3.73/5 and 3.85/5). However, sources of information were missing, content was biased, and few videos discussed possible gaps in knowledge.
Conclusion
As patients increasingly turn to social media for medical information, it is imperative for OBGYNs to have a deeper understanding of TikTok's representation of endometriosis as it is a powerful motivator of patient behavior.}

With the emergence of pre-trained models, text classification tasks have become homogeneous, without a significant improvement in accuracy. Therefore, we present a hybrid model called PLASA to classify the sentiment polarity of short comments, particularly barrages. PLASA introduces a collaborative attention module that integrates information about relative position and knowledge from summarized lexicons to better adjust the relationship between word representations. Our model is evaluated using three new curated sentiment analysis datasets: SentiTikTok-2023 (4613 items), SentiBilibili-2023 (7755 items), and SentiWeibo-2023 (5614 items). Although the comment length varies across datasets, all maintain a consistent punctuation percentage at approximately 13%. Consequently, PLASA with the optimal combination demonstrates notable performance improvements compared to both the baseline and commonly used models. It achieves micro-F1 scores of 93.94%, 90.34%, and 88.79% on the respective datasets. We also observed that the representation capacity of the pre-trained model decreases as the text length increases. Moreover, the proposed collaborative attention module effectively addresses this limitation, as confirmed by our ablation study.}

abstract = {Background
Social media platforms, like TikTok, have become popular options for the consumption and distribution of healthcare information. Due to the lack of scientific oversight, the consistency of healthcare-related videos has become a focus of the current literature. However, orthopaedic surgery has lagged behind other specialties in acknowledging the widespread utilization of TikTok videos for medical information. This study aims to assess the quality and educational benefits of Achilles tendinopathy-related TikTok videos.
Methods
TikTok was queried using the hashtags "#achillestendonexercises”, “achillestendonitisexercises", "achillestendinosisexercises", and "achillestendinopathyexercises". 100 videos (25 for each term) were included after applying the exclusion criteria. The number of views, likes, shares, comments, and favorites was recorded. The content was graded using DISCERN (a well-validated informational analysis tool) and ATEES (a self-designed tool for exercise evaluation).
Results
The total number of views of the 100 videos was 1647,148, with a median of 7562.5 (IQR = 2,281- 19,575). The videos collectively received 73,765 likes, 1125 comments, 14,491 favorites and 6897 shares with a median of 283 (IQR= 73.8–957.8), 7 (IQR= 1.8–16.0), 61.5 (IQR= 8.8–184.3), and 18.5 (IQR= 2.0–49.8), respectively. General users uploaded slightly less (48%) when compared to healthcare professionals (52%). Healthcare professionals had more videos graded as “very poor” (43.4%) in comparison to the general users (36.2%). General users had more videos graded as “poor” (63.8%) in comparison to healthcare professionals (54.7%). However, there were no significant differences between the groups on either of the video grading scales.
Conclusion
Although TikTok is a powerful tool for information distribution, the educational value of the videos related to Achilles tendinopathy exercises was poor. With only 1% of videos receiving a grade of ‘fair,’ and no videos reaching a score of ‘good’ or ‘excellent’, healthcare professionals should be aware of the high viewership of low-quality content easily accessible on TikTok.

Videos with higher view counts were liked and shared at higher rates and sustained viewer attention for longer. Properties like hashtags, sounds, and effects did not significantly influence video views. Interestingly, videos summarizing research papers received the highest levels of engagement, potentially reflecting high demand from lay audiences who are traditionally unable to access scientific literature.

abstract = {Background
Outbreaks of influenza-like illness (ILI) pose ongoing public health challenges, prompting widespread demand for timely and accessible health information. TikTok, a leading short video platform, has emerged as an overarching channel for disseminating health-related content, particularly in mainland China. While previous studies have examined health communication on social media, few have integrated complementary theoretical frameworks to understand how user perceptions and motivations jointly influence health behaviors.
Objective
This study integrates the situational theory of problem solving (STOPS) and the technology acceptance model (TAM) to examine the communicative actions and intentions of Chinese TikTok users to adopt health protective behaviors in response to ILI.
Methods
A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in China between June and July 2023 using convenience and snowball sampling. A total of 1109 valid responses were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Constructs from STOPS (problem recognition, constraint recognition, involvement recognition, situational motivation, and communicative action in problem solving) and TAM (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitude) were measured alongside risk perception and intention to engage in protective behaviors.
Results
Perceived usefulness (β=.344; P<.001) and ease of use (β=.359; P<.001) positively influenced the attitude toward using TikTok. Risk perception (β=.050, P=.02) had a small but significant impact on attitude. Situational motivation was positively predicted by risk perception (β=.154; P<.001), problem recognition (β=.153; P<.001), and involvement recognition (β=.248; P<.001) but negatively predicted by constraint recognition (β=−.265; P<.001). Both attitude (β=.390; P<.001) and situational motivation (β=.471; P<.001) significantly influenced communicative action, which in turn predicted intention to practice protective behaviors (β=.570; P<.001). Mediation analyses confirmed the partial mediating roles of attitude and situational motivation.
Conclusions
TikTok is an effective platform for public health communication in China, particularly for ILI-related content. Integrating the STOPS and TAM provides a robust framework for explaining how user perceptions and motivations translate into digital engagement and health protective intentions. These findings suggest that interventions should not only enhance technological usability and credibility but also tailor content to elevate perceived personal relevance and reduce psychological or contextual constraints. Future public health campaigns can benefit from engaging influencers, using participatory content formats, and targeting specific motivational cues to increase user involvement in health communication and behavioral change. Caution is warranted in generalizing these results because of the culturally specific and demographically skewed nature of the sample.}

However, patients in China typically experience a high incidence of this condition, coupled with a low level of health knowledge and a relatively low rate of surgical treatment. TikTok hosts a vast amount of content related to diseases and health knowledge, providing viewers with access to relevant information. However, there has been no investigation or evaluation of the quality of videos specifically addressing MR.
Objective
This study aims to assess the quality of videos about MR on TikTok in China.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted on the Chinese version of TikTok on September 9, 2023. The top 100 videos on MR were included and evaluated using quantitative scoring tools such as the modified DISCERN (mDISCERN), the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria, the Global Quality Score (GQS), and the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audio-Visual Content (PEMAT-A/V). Correlation and stepwise regression analyses were performed to examine the relationships between video quality and various characteristics.
Results
We obtained 88 valid video files, of which most (n=81, 92%) were uploaded by certified physicians, primarily cardiac surgeons, and cardiologists. News agencies/organizations and physicians had higher GQS scores compared with individuals (news agencies/organizations vs individuals, P=.001; physicians vs individuals, P=.03). Additionally, news agencies/organizations had higher PEMAT understandability scores than individuals (P=.01). Videos focused on disease knowledge scored higher in GQS (P<.001), PEMAT understandability (P<.001), and PEMAT actionability (P<.001) compared with videos covering surgical cases. PEMAT actionability scores were higher for outpatient cases compared with surgical cases (P<.001). Additionally, videos focused on surgical techniques had lower PEMAT actionability scores than those about disease knowledge (P=.04). The strongest correlations observed were between thumbs up and comments (r=0.92, P<.001), thumbs up and favorites (r=0.89, P<.001), thumbs up and shares (r=0.87, P<.001), comments and favorites (r=0.81, P<.001), comments and shares (r=0.87, P<.001), and favorites and shares (r=0.83, P<.001). Stepwise regression analysis identified “length (P<.001),” “content (P<.001),” and “physicians (P=.004)” as significant predictors of GQS. The final model (model 3) explained 50.1% of the variance in GQSs. The predictive equation for GQS is as follows: GQS = 3.230 − 0.294 × content − 0.274 × physicians + 0.005 × length. This model was statistically significant (P=.004) and showed no issues with multicollinearity or autocorrelation.
Conclusions
Our study reveals that while most MR-related videos on TikTok were uploaded by certified physicians, ensuring professional and scientific content, the overall quality scores were suboptimal. Despite the educational value of these videos, the guidance provided was often insufficient. The predictive equation for GQS developed from our analysis offers valuable insights but should be applied with caution beyond the study context. It suggests that creators should focus on improving both the content and presentation of their videos to enhance the quality of health information shared on social media.}

abstract = {Objective
Previous research has found that exposure to abortion plotlines on fictional television programs may influence viewers’ knowledge about abortion, and that examining comments under health-related YouTube videos provides insight into discourse around the health topics. We conducted an exploratory quantitative content analysis of YouTube video clips from television abortion plotlines and comments.
Study Design
We identified YouTube clips posted in a five-year period (2018–2023) on official network accounts that depicted abortion plotlines. Two research assistants independently coded the top 20 comments and associated replies for each video using a systematically developed codebook. We calculated descriptive statistics and used chi-square tests to assess for differences in the distribution of content code by sentiment.
Results
Of the 275 abortion plotlines in our sample period, we identified 25 YouTube videos that met our inclusion criteria. Fifteen of these clips had more than 10 relevant comments, for a total of 619 relevant comments. Slightly less than half (43.8 %) expressed abortion positive sentiment, 22.0 % expressed abortion restrictive sentiment, and 19 % expressed complex sentiment. The most frequent content category was arguing with another poster (41.2 %,) followed by hostility toward another poster (16.2 %). Potential misinformation was present in 10.4 % of comments; these were significantly more likely to express abortion restrictive sentiment compared to abortion positive or complex sentiment (p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Results of this exploratory study suggest that YouTube comments posted under abortion plotline videos express a mix of sentiment, and social media data may offer a unique opportunity for researchers to investigate viewers’ reactions to these plotlines.}

An extensive dataset was assembled, comprising 4984 product introduction video segments from 768 TikTok livestreaming rooms in China, along with 1.29 million bullet screen comments and 513,551 viewers' information. Employing advanced multimodal data processing technologies, the study extracted anchors' (livestreaming hosts) multimodal emotion features. The empirical findings demonstrate the significant impact of anchors' emotions, encompassing body movements, facial expressions, voices, and conversation contents, on the arousal and valence of group emotions, where the latter exhibit opposing effects on instant order cancellation behavior. This research establishes the paramount roles of anchor and group emotions in viewers' instant order cancellation behaviors, lending credence to the epistemological applicability of emotional contagion theory in the context of LSE. The study's findings offer LSE practitioners practical implications to enhance business decision-making, fostering more engaging and emotionally resonant livestreaming experiences to reduce cancellations and improve customer retention.}

Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is a rare condition that causes alternation of at least two separate personality states and has a prevalence of less than 1% in the general population. This study aims to appraise the social media platforms, YouTube and TikTok, as sources of medical information on DID.
Methods
YouTube and TikTok were queried using the following search phrases: “Dissociative Identity Disorder,” “Multiple Personality Disorder,” and “Split Personality Disorder.” The top 60 videos by views for YouTube and likes for TikTok were selected from each search term on each platform. Videos were reviewed by four independent reviewers using a modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) Scale, Global Quality Scale (GQS), and they were further classified as useful, misleading, or neither useful or misleading.
Results
Number of videos that met criteria were 60 YouTube videos and 97 TikTok videos. After classification, 51.7% of YouTube videos were useful while only 5.2% of TikTok videos were useful. A significant difference was found between (mDISCERN and GQS) score and the video source, type of content, and classification (α < 0.05).
Limitations
This study focused exclusively on English videos. Additionally, it did not evaluate other social media platforms that are used worldwide.
Conclusion
This results of this study show the need for healthcare professionals and organizations to not only create content of high quality but increase engagement on social media platforms, particularly TikTok, in order to educate users on DID.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the quality of varicocele information on TikTok, a popular video platform that adolescent patients are now turning to as a source of medical information before visiting a doctor.
Methods
Using the key word “varicocele,” we retrieved the top 225 videos listed on TikTok in May 2022. We extracted general video and engagement data. Video information was coded and analyzed for the completeness of different types of content (definition, symptoms, evaluation, management, and outcomes). The quality of consumer health information was rated using the DISCERN instrument.
Results
Thirty-six videos met inclusion criteria; 17 were created by general users, 16 by healthcare professionals or systems (2 by urologists), and 3 by scientific communities. Healthcare professionals had more views than non-healthcare (P = .05). The quality of health information using the DISCERN instrument was “poor” from health care professional videos and “very poor” from non-health care professionals. However, the quality of information provided by healthcare professionals was statistically better than that of non-healthcare (P< .05). Video content mainly focused on symptoms: 50% of videos from healthcare providers had some or extensive content and 41% of non-healthcare had some content. 23% of videos had misinformation.
Conclusion
The overall quality of information for varicoceles on TikTok is not acceptable and does not meet patient needs. It is imperative that urologists create robust, accurate content, and partner with these platforms to connect users with higher quality information. TikTok users should also be mindful that information may not be medically accurate.}

Influencers organize sentences of different sentiment valence in a specific sequence when offering products’ basic information, sharing usage experiences, and providing product evaluations in the product recommendation posts, resulting in dynamic changes in sentence sentiment valence, that is, sentiment volatility. Drawing on narrative transportation theory, an investigation—combining an analysis of 12,849 influencer product recommendation posts on the Xiaohongshu platform (Study 1) and a further controlled experiment (Study 2) — reveals that sentiment volatility negatively affects customer engagement and this effect is driven by narrative transportation.

The Mediterranean diet has been linked to reduced risk for several cardiometabolic diseases. The lack of a clear definition of the Mediterranean diet in the scientific literature and the documented proliferation of nutrition misinformation on the internet suggest the potential for confusion among consumers seeking web-based Mediterranean diet information.
Objective
We conducted a social media content analysis of information about the Mediterranean diet on the influential social media platform, TikTok, to examine public discourse about the diet and identify potential areas of misinformation. We then analyzed these findings in the context of health promotion to identify potential challenges and opportunities for the use of TikTok in promoting the Mediterranean diet for healthy living.
Methods
The first-appearing 202 TikTok posts that resulted from a search of the hashtag #mediterraneandiet were downloaded and qualitatively examined. Post features and characteristics, poster information, and engagement metrics were extracted and synthesized across posts. Posts were categorized as those created by health professionals and those created by nonhealth professionals based on poster-reported credentials. In addition to descriptive statistics of the entire sample, we compared posts created by professionals and nonprofessionals for content using chi-square tests.
Results
TikTok posts varied in content, but posts that were developed by health professionals versus nonprofessionals were more likely to offer a definition of the Mediterranean diet (16/106, 15.1% vs 2/96, 2.1%; P=.001), use scientific citations to support claims (26/106, 24.5% vs 0/96, 0%; P<.001), and discuss specific nutrients (33/106, 31.1% vs 6/96, 6.3%; P<.001) and diseases related to the diet (27/106, 25.5% vs 5/96, 5.2%; P<.001) compared to posts created by nonhealth professionals.
Conclusions
Social media holds promise as a venue to promote the Mediterranean diet, but the variability in information found in this study highlights the need to create clear definitions about the diet and its components when developing Mediterranean diet interventions that use new media structures.}

abstract = {Background
Food and beverage marketing is an important influence on the health and diets of adolescents. Food and beverage companies spend billions of dollars annually on advertisements to promote their products and are increasingly focusing on social media influencers. Influencer product endorsements blur the line between entertainment and marketing.
Objective
This study aimed to quantify how often TikTok influencers promote products from food and beverage brands and document the range of ways they disclose brand relationships in their content.
Methods
We collected up to 100 videos posted on or before July 1, 2022, from each of the top 100 influencers on TikTok in the United States and recorded information about the influencer (eg, number of followers) and video (eg, number of views and likes). For each video that contained food or beverage products, we identified the main product featured. A team of research assistants then coded each video for how the product was featured (ie, in the video, audio, or caption) and, for branded products, whether the video was accompanied by any disclosures of brand relationships. Average pairwise percentage agreement among coders was 92%, and average pairwise Cohen κ was 0.82.
Results
Among the 8871 videos from 97 influencers that made up the final analytical sample, we identified 1360 videos (15.3%) that featured at least one food or beverage product. These 1360 videos were viewed >9 million times and received >1 million likes each. Nearly half (n=648, 47.6%) of the videos featured a branded product. Most videos featuring a branded product did not contain a brand relationship disclosure (n=449, 69.3%). Among videos that disclosed a brand relationship, influencers used 10 different types of disclosures. Tagging a brand in the video’s caption was the most common disclosure method (n=182, 28.1%). Six types of caption hashtags were used to disclose brand relationships, including #[brandname] (n=63, 9.7%) and #ad (n=30, 4.6%). Only 1 video (0.2%) made use of TikTok’s official disclosure label and only 1 video (0.2%) verbally mentioned a contractual agreement with a brand.
Conclusions
Among the food and beverage videos with disclosures we identified, the most frequently used mechanism—tagging the brand—did not clearly differentiate between sponsored content and the influencer trying to attract a brand or followers who may like that brand. Social media users, particularly adolescents, need clearer, more robust disclosures from influencers to protect against the undue influence of food marketing. These findings may also inform calls for the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative—the largest self-regulatory pledge to reduce unhealthy food marketing—to include older adolescents, who are heavily targeted by food and beverage companies on social media.}

abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate the quality of meniscus-related TikTok videos to better understand their value for patient education.
Methods
The term “meniscus” was used as the key word for an extensive online search of video content on the TikTok on November 14, 2023. The first 100 videos were used for analysis. The duration of the videos and the number of likes, shares, and views were recorded for each video. Furthermore, videos were categorized based on the source (health workers, private user), the type of subject (patient experience, physical therapy, anatomy, clinical examination, surgical technique and injury mechanism), type of content (patient experience/testimony, education, rehabilitation), and the presence of music or voice. The quality and reliability assessments of video contents were conducted using the DISCERN instrument, the Journal of the American Medical Association benchmark criteria, and Global Quality Score.
Results
Of the 100 videos included in this study, 62 (62%) videos were published by health workers and 38 by private users (38%). Most of the information regarded patient experience (36, 36%), followed by physical therapy (32, 32%), anatomy (14, 14%), clinical examination (8, 8%), surgical technique (6, 6%), and injury mechanism (4, 4%). Video content reported patient experience in 39 (39%) videos, rehabilitation in 31 (31%) videos, and education in the remaining 30 (30%). The mean length of the videos was 39.12 ± 49.56 seconds. The mean number of views was 1,383,001.65 ± 5,291,822.28, whereas the mean numbers of comments, likes and shares were 408.53 ± 1976.90, 54,763.43 ± 211,823.44 and 873.70 ± 2,802.01, respectively. The mean DISCERN score, Journal of the American Medical Association benchmark criteria score, and Global Quality Score were 17.93 ± 5.07, 0.24 ± 0.47, and 1.15 ± 0.41, respectively.
Conclusions
Meniscus-related videos on TikTok are widely viewed and shared but the overall educational value to patients is poor.
Clinical Relevance
As patients increasingly use social media to learn about their conditions, it is important for orthopaedic health care professionals to understand the limitations of TikTok videos addressing the meniscus as potential sources of information for their patients.}

Based on a grounded-theory analysis, body-positivity themes included Broadly Conceptualizing Beauty (i.e., diversity in appearance types is beautiful), Body Acceptance and Love (i.e., love for and comfort in one’s body), and Critiquing Standards (i.e., rejecting strict appearance standards). Body-neutrality themes included Size Inclusivity (i.e., people’s activities/preferences should be based on body size), Adaptive Self-Investment (i.e., self care focused on health), Body Appreciation (i.e., respect for what one’s body can do), and No Judgment (i.e., a person’s worth should not be based on appearance). Further, based on a content analysis of 394 TikTok vidoes that were hashtagged with body positivity and/or body neutrality terms, at least one body-positivity theme occurred in 35.3% (n = 141) of videos, and at least one body neutrality theme occurred in 45.0% (n = 180) of videos. Body Acceptance and Love was the most common body-positivity theme, and Size Inclusivity was the most common body-neutrality theme. Understanding how TikTok videos present body positivity and neutrality is essential to further theorizing about how they might affect social media users.}

abstract = {Background
Childhood vaccination rates in the UK have declined for the thirteenth year in a row. This study explores parents' vaccination experiences to identify key barriers affecting uptake, helping stakeholders better understand and support families.
Methods
A qualitative longitudinal study following a cohort (n = 22) of parents from birth to age one. Three waves of data collection took place in line with key vaccination due dates at approximately two (July 2023–February 2024), four (October 2023–May 2024), and twelve months of age (May 2024–December 2024). In total, the dataset comprises 63 interviews and 98 diary entries (including 119 picture submissions) across all waves of data collection. Data were analysed using temporal thematic analysis.
Results
Information provision was a critical temporal theme accounting for divergences in parents' experiences and, in some instances, the outcome of their vaccination journeys. Parents received minimal information in the lead up to vaccination and during the appointment itself. Parents had different relationships with vaccination (confident, curious, or concerned), however, this was subject to change between waves of data collection. In addition to a lack of proactive information provision, there was nowhere for parents to turn to having developed vaccine-related concerns leaving some stuck “on the fence”. Parents were further nudged towards vaccine deferral or refusal based on a breakdown of trust with their General Practice, search engine results, and content on social media.
Conclusion
To address declining vaccination coverage in England, it is essential that parents have opportunities to meaningfully discuss their questions with healthcare providers. For many, information provision is too little, too late, and there is no opportunity for dialogue. This study deepens our understanding of parents' experiences of information provision regarding childhood vaccinations and provides recommendations for policy and practice.}

The findings not only illustrate the approaches taken by three content creators to the explanation of the term (i.e., contrastive, pedagogical, and metamorphic), but also shed light on the multimodal nature of stance-taking on TikTok and the centrality of embodied practices in the mediated era.

The proposed BangDSA dataset approximately follows the Zipf’s law, covering 32.84% function words with a vocabulary growth rate of 0.053, tagged both on 15 and 3 categories. In this study, we have implemented 21 different hybrid feature extraction methods including Bag of Words (BOW), N-gram, TF-IDF, TF-IDF-ICF, Word2Vec, FastText, GloVe, Bangla-BERT etc with CBOW and Skipgram mechanisms. The proposed novel method (Bangla-BERT＋Skipgram), skipBangla-BERT outperforms all other feature extraction techniques in machine leaning (ML), ensemble learning (EL) and deep learning (DL) approaches. Among the built models from ML, EL and DL domains the hybrid method CNN-BiLSTM surpasses the others. The best acquired accuracy for the CNN-BiLSTM model is 90.24% in 15 categories and 95.71% in 3 categories. Friedman test has been performed on the obtained results to observe the statistical significance. For both real 15 and 3 categories, the results of the statistical test are significant.}

One subset of popular eating-related content is “What I Eat in a Day” (#WhatIEatInADay), in which a creator documents the food they eat over the assumed span of a single day. We sought to evaluate the content of TikTok #WhatIEatInADay videos (N = 100) using reflexive thematic analysis. Two primary types of videos emerged. First, Lifestyle videos (N = 60), which included aesthetic elements, presentations of clean eating, stylized meals, promotion of weight loss and the thin ideal, normalization of eating as a fat woman, and disordered eating content. Second, Eating Only videos (N = 40), which were primarily focused on food, and included upbeat music, an emphasis on highly palatable foods, displays of irony, emojis, and excessive consumption of food. Because viewing eating-related social media content has been associated with disordered eating, both types of TikTok #WhatIEatInADay videos may be harmful to vulnerable youth. Given the popularity of TikTok and #WhatIEatinADay, clinicians and researchers should consider the potential impact of this trend. Future research should examine the impact of viewing TikTok #WhatIEatInADay videos on disordered eating risk factors and behaviors.}

The acquisition process includes collecting data from social media platforms, starting with keyword searching, querying, and scraping, resulting in an acquired dataset. The subsequent annotation process involves refining and labelling, starting with data merging, selection, and annotation, ending in an annotated dataset. Three expert annotators from different fields were appointed for the labelling tasks, which produced determinations of sentiment and sarcasm in the content. Additionally, an annotator specialized in literature was appointed for language identification of each content. This dataset represents a valuable contribution to the field of natural language processing and machine learning, especially within the public security domain and for multilingual countries in Southeast Asia.}

abstract = {Background
On October 11, 2023, Netflix released the docuseries “Big Vape: The Rise and Fall of JUUL,” which chronicled the founding of JUUL, its rise in popularity among youth, and the subsequent public backlash. The official Netflix YouTube channel posted a trailer promoting the docuseries and an official clip from the docuseries. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of using comments posted under YouTube videos to analyze reactions to the content and discourse around the health topics explored in the video.
Objective
This study aimed to (1) systematically characterize nicotine and tobacco product (NTP)–related comments and replies posted in response to the docuseries trailer and video clip and (2) explore integration of automated topic modeling techniques with traditional human-generated qualitative coding.
Methods
We extracted all comments and replies on the aforementioned YouTube clips 1 month after the docuseries’ release (N=532). Research assistants manually double-coded the comments using a systematically developed codebook that assessed for NTP sentiment (pro-NTP, anti-NTP, complex sentiment, or no sentiment) and the presence or absence of specific electronic cigarette (e-cigarette)–related content. Given the substantial amount of comments coded as potential misinformation during the coding process, we conducted an in-depth qualitative content analysis of all comments coded as potential misinformation. Simultaneously, we used word clustering techniques including structural topic modeling to identify the overarching topics.
Results
Of the 73.8% ( 393/532) relevant comments, 63.6% (250/393) expressed NTP sentiment with 42.8% of these (107/250) expressing pro-NTP sentiment and 18.4% (46/250) expressing complex sentiment. The most frequent content category was potential misinformation (27.5%, 108/393). These 108 comments contained 152 individual pieces of misinformation that were broadly grouped within 6 themes with various numbers of subthemes; the most frequent misinformation theme was that e-cigarette use is completely safe or much safer than smoking (n=80). Other frequently occurring content categories included e-cigarette use is safer than smoking (17.6%, 69/393), and personal experience using e-cigarettes or JUUL (15.5%, 61/393). For topic modeling, we identified 9 topics that we qualitatively assigned into 4 thematic categories: comparisons with other drugs, mentions of government and pharma companies, role of media and parents, and harms associated with nicotine and tobacco products.
Conclusions
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine viewer reactions to the docuseries about JUUL. Our analysis of YouTube comments offers insight into current sentiment and misinformation regarding NTPs and highlights the potential utility of using mixed methods to analyze NTP-related social media data, and the benefits of integrating computational and human qualitative research to analyze social media perceptions of e-cigarettes. Public health professionals can use our findings to help develop tailored health communication messages to address common sentiment and misconceptions related to JUUL, other e-cigarette products, and new NTP products.}

abstract = {Background
Lupus erythematosus (LE) is an autoimmune condition that is associated with significant detriments to quality of life and daily functioning. TikTok, a popular social networking platform for sharing short videos, provides a unique opportunity to understand experiences with LE within a nonclinical sample, a population that is understudied in LE research. This is the first qualitative study that explores LE experiences using the TikTok platform.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the disease-related experiences of TikTok users with LE using qualitative and content analysis.
Methods
TikTok videos were included if the hashtags included #lupus, were downloadable, were in English, and involved the personal experience of an individual with LE. A codebook was developed using a standardized inductive approach of iterative coding until saturation was reached. NVivo (Lumivero), a qualitative analysis software platform, was used to code videos and perform content analysis. Inductive thematic analysis was used to derive themes from the data.
Results
A total of 153 TikTok videos met the inclusion criteria. The most common codes were experiences with symptoms (106/153, 69.3%), mucocutaneous symptoms (61/153, 39.9%), and experiences with treatment (59/153, 38.6%). Experiences with symptoms and mucocutaneous symptoms had the greatest cumulative views (25,381,074 and 14,879,109 views, respectively). Five thematic conclusions were derived from the data: (1) mucocutaneous symptoms had profound effects on the mental health and body image of TikTok users with LE; (2) TikTok users’ negative experiences with health care workers were often derived from diagnostic delays and perceptions of “medical gaslighting”; (3) TikTok users tended to portray pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions, such as diet and naturopathic remedies, positively, whereas pharmacologic treatments were portrayed negatively or referred to as “chemotherapy”; (4) LE symptoms, particularly musculoskeletal symptoms and fatigue, interfered with users’ daily functioning; and (5) although TikTok users frequently had strong support systems, feelings of isolation were often attributed to battling an “invisible illness.”
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that social media can provide important, clinically relevant information for health practitioners caring for patients with chronic conditions such as LE. As mucocutaneous symptoms were the predominant drivers of distress in our sample, the treatment of hair loss and rash is vital in this population. However, pharmacologic therapies were often depicted negatively, reinforcing the significance of discussions on the safety and effectiveness of these treatments. In addition, while TikTok users demonstrated robust support systems, feelings of having an “invisible illness” and “medical gaslighting” dominated negative interactions with others. This underscores the importance of providing validation in clinical interactions.}

abstract = {Background
Disseminating disease knowledge through concise videos on various platforms is an innovative and efficient approach. However, it remains uncertain whether pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET)-related videos available on current short video platforms can effectively convey accurate and impactful information to the general public.
Objective
Our study aims to extensively analyze the quality of pNET-related videos on TikTok and Bilibili, intending to enhance the development of pNET-related social media content to provide the general public with more comprehensive and suitable avenues for accessing pNET-related information.
Methods
A total of 168 qualifying videos pertaining to pNETs were evaluated from the video-sharing platforms Bilibili and TikTok. Initially, the fundamental information conveyed in the videos was documented. Subsequently, we discerned the source and content type of each video. Following that, the Global Quality Scale (GQS) and modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) scale were employed to appraise the educational value and quality of each video. A comparative evaluation was conducted on the videos obtained from these two platforms.
Results
The number of pNET-related videos saw a significant increase since 2020, with 9 videos in 2020, 19 videos in 2021, 29 videos in 2022, and 106 videos in 2023. There were no significant improvements in the mean GQS or mDISCERN scores from 2020 to 2023, which were 3.22 and 3.00 in 2020, 3.33 and 2.94 in 2021, 2.83 and 2.79 in 2022, and 2.78 and 2.94 in 2023, respectively. The average quality scores of the videos on Bilibili and Tiktok were comparable, with GQS and mDISCERN scores of 2.98 on Bilibili versus 2.77 on TikTok and 2.82 on Bilibili versus 3.05 on TikTok, respectively. The source and format of the videos remained independent factors affecting the two quality scores. Videos that were uploaded by professionals (hazard ratio=7.02, P=.002) and recorded in specialized popular science formats (hazard ratio=12.45, P<.001) tended to exhibit superior quality.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that the number of short videos on pNETs has increased in recent years, but video quality has not improved significantly. This comprehensive analysis shows that the source and format of videos are independent factors affecting video quality, which provides potential measures for improving the quality of short videos.}

abstract = {Background
TikTok was an important channel for consumers to access and adopt health information. But the quality of health content in TikTok remains underinvestigated.
Objective
Our study aimed to identify upload sources, contents, and feature information of gallstone disease videos on TikTok and further evaluated the factors related to video quality.
Methods
We investigated the first 100 gallstone-related videos on TikTok and analyzed these videos’ upload sources, content, and characteristics. The quality of videos was evaluated using quantitative scoring tools such as DISCERN instrument, the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria, and Global Quality Scores (GQS). Moreover, the correlation between video quality and video characteristics, including duration, likes, comments, and shares, was further investigated.
Results
According to video sources, 81% of the videos were posted by doctors. Furthermore, disease knowledge was the most dominant video content, accounting for 56% of all the videos. The mean DISCERN, JAMA, and GQS scores of all 100 videos are 39.61 (SD 11.36), 2.00 (SD 0.40), and 2.76 (SD 0.95), respectively. According to DISCERN and GQS, gallstone-related videos’ quality score on TikTok is not high, mainly at fair (43/100, 43%,) and moderate (46/100, 46%). The total DISCERN scores of doctors were significantly higher than that of individuals and news agencies, surgery techniques were significantly higher than lifestyle and news, and disease knowledge was significantly higher than news, respectively. DISCERN scores and video duration were positively correlated. Negative correlations were found between DISCERN scores and likes and shares of videos. In GQS analysis, no significant differences were found between groups based on different sources or different contents. JAMA was excluded in the video quality and correlation analysis due to a lack of discrimination and inability to evaluate the video quality accurately.
Conclusions
Although the videos of gallstones on TikTok are mainly provided by doctors and contain disease knowledge, they are of low quality. We found a positive correlation between video duration and video quality. High-quality videos received low attention, and popular videos were of low quality. Medical information on TikTok is currently not rigorous enough to guide patients to make accurate judgments. TikTok was not an appropriate source of knowledge to educate patients due to the low quality and reliability of the information.}

This cross-sectional study aimed to describe the content of the first 100 video results under the hashtag #Ozempic on TikTok. Videos extracted from TikTok were primarily uploaded by consumers and viewed ∼ 70 million times. The coding sheet encompassed basic information (including the URL identifier, date of upload, view count, number of likes, number of shares, and indication of whether the video was uploaded by consumers or professionals), and 19 content categories. Only two of the 19 content characteristics were covered in the majority (>50%) of the videos, “mentions being on/taking Ozempic or others taking/using/planning to use Ozempic” (n = 69), garnering over 43 million views) and “mentions being used for weight loss” (n = 57), garnering over 44 million views). Over one-third (n = 35), garnering over 31 million views, included content that “encourages/entices other people to try Ozempic/presents Ozempic as a coveted drug/portrays Ozempic positively.” Less than 5% of the sample mentioned “off label prescription use” (n = 3), “bariatric surgery for weight loss” (n = 3), or “medication shortage” that may result from off label use (n = 1). Healthcare professionals, regulatory bodies, and social media platforms should collaborate to address the challenges posed by viral trends resulting in medication shortages with potentially consequential outcomes for people with diabetes.}

abstract = {Summary
Purpose
Social media platforms are popular sources of medical information but may harbor harmful misinformation. This study aims to evaluate the effect of TikTok on the transgender population, which may be more likely to seek information from non-traditional sources because of high medical mistrust.
Methods
Twenty gender affirmation related hashtags were queried, with the top 25 videos per hashtag included for analysis. Videos were categorized based on the content and creator. Variables included likes, comments, shares, and video views. All “educational” videos were analyzed for reliability of information using a modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) score and the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PMAT). Kruskal-Wallis H tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and simple linear regression models were used in analysis.
Results
A total of 429 videos amassed 571,434,231 views, 108,050,498 likes, 2,151,572 comments, and 190,9744 shares. Patients were the majority of content creators (74.88%), with patient experiences being the majority of videos (36.07%). Non-physician creators had significantly higher likes and comments when compared to physicians (6185 vs. 1645, p = 0.028; 108 vs. 47, p = 0.016 respectively). Sixty “educational” videos were included in information reliability analysis. There were no significant differences between video characteristics of different content creators, even after stratifying according to physician status. Significant differences were observed in the reliability of information according to PMAT and mDISCERN scores, with physician created videos being significantly higher rated than non-physician created videos (0.90 vs. 0.84, p < 0.001; 3 vs. 2, p < 0.001, respectively).
Conclusion
Lower quality information is associated with non-physician content creators. We encourage physicians to be continuously involved in creating quality information on TikTok.}

ChatGPT is an advanced chatbot powered by the Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) architecture, designed to generate human-like conversations encompassing a wide range of knowledge domains. Many AI researchers are currently engaging with the new technology to understand its functionality and limitations. Various expressions across a range of social media platforms, including Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and numerous others, are currently under investigation. This research seeks to analyze the opinions of ChatGPT users as it regards cybersecurity. This research is important due to its contribution towards gaining enhanced understanding and devising intricate improvements for the chatbot. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm is utilized to extract relevant topics from the texts. Additionally, to analyze user opinions and decipher the sentiments as either positive, negative, or neutral, we use the Natural language tool kit Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning (NLTK's VADER) and Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (roBERTa) libraries. The data used is obtained from Twitter via the SNScrape library, which aided in the retrieval of over 700,000 tweets via the search terms #chatgptsecurity, #chatgpthackers, #chatgptcybersecurity, and #chatgptcyberthreats. The analysis of the results by the VADER model shows 43.8% positive, 36.3% neutral, and 19.9% negative sentiments. Similarly, the roBERTa model shows 14.1% positive, 53.2% neutral, and 32.7% negative. These results show that there is an ongoing concern about ChatGPT and cybersecurity, especially in malware code generation, hacking, intelligence gathering, and phishing attacks.}

To evaluate the quality, source, popularity, visibility and reliability of Tiktok videos on dental implants.
Materials and Methods
A Tiktok search for dental implants was performed English language setting. Search hashtags were determined as “#dentalimplants,” “#dentalimplantsurgery,” “#dentalimplantstreatment,” and “#implantdentistry.” 148 of the 300 videos watched were included the study. Two periodontologists scored the videos for quality, reliability, utility, visibility and popularity. Videos' quality was evaluated using the Global Quality Scale (GQS) and the DISCERN tools, by categorizing them through quality of communication, duration, likes and dislikes, views, source and video type of each video were recorded.
Results
There was significant positive correlation between “GQS” and “Total DISCERN” (Rho: 0.636) and “Duration in seconds” (Rho: 0.343) (p<0.05). For Total DISCERN, averages of the 31-45 seconds (p=0.010) and 46 seconds and above (p=.018) groups were higher than the averages of the 0-15 seconds group and average of the Educational group was higher than the average of the Testimonial, Product Advertisement and Entertainment groups (p=0.001, p=0.033 and p=0.041). Healthcare professionals mostly upload GQS 2 score videos and Hospital/Universities mostly upload GQS 2 and 3 score videos (p<0.05). Testimonial videos mostly receive GQS2 score videos and the 'Videos rich in supplementary visuals' quality also receives the most GQS4 score videos (p<0.05).
Conclusions
The results of this study demonstrate that TikTok videos provide low to moderate quality information about dental implants and that TikTok may not provide reliable information about dental implants.}

TikTok is a popular social media platform where individuals make and share short videos, including activity challenges. Younger generations comprise the majority of TikTok users and are more impressionable to impersonate these challenges. The challenges range in severity of potential hazard, with the Benadryl challenge being one of the high-risk challenges. Case Details: Here, we report a case of a 14-year-old female who presented with a seizure from diphenhydramine (Benadryl) overdose following participation in the TikTok Benadryl Challenge.
Discussion
One of the more common reasons why people participate in the challenges is for a sense of belonging. Physicians and parents should learn the motivation behind engagement to help facilitate conversations and educate adolescents on the safety of the different social media challenges.
Conclusion
It may be beneficial to assess motivation behind participation in social media challenges in patients with pre-existing mental health conditions and those without in order to ascertain possible differences in risk factors. As healthcare professionals, it is essential to emphasize to parents and other caregivers the importance of supervising kids’ use of social media and that inappropriate use can lead to life-threatening situations or long-term negative effects.}

abstract = {Background
In the current digital age, individuals often look to the widely used social media application “TikTok” to obtain information about autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite this, no studies have evaluated the quality of information available about ASD on the app. Our aim was to investigate the understandability, actionability, and usefulness of TikTok videos about ASD.
Methods
To evaluate video quality, 100 videos tagged with “autism spectrum disorder” were obtained from TikTok between June 19th-21st, 2023. Videos were included if they pertained to ASD and excluded if they were not in English, unrelated to ASD, or duplicates. Two systems were used to assess the videos. The Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audio- Visual Materials (PEMAT-A/V) was used to obtain percentage scores for video understandability and actionability. The videos were also sorted into one of three categories: useful, personal experience, or misleading (UPM). The assignment was based on if they contained factual information, anecdotal personal experiences, or incorrect information, respectively.
Results
Of the 100 videos analyzed, 24 % were classified as useful; 36 % as personal experience; and 40 % as misleading. They had a mean PEMAT-A/V understandability score of 60.1 % (SD=14.5, range=31.0–91.7 %) and a median PEMAT-A/V actionability score of 0 % (IQR=0–0, range=0–100 %). The breakdown of topics discussed in the videos were as follows: 62 % of videos discussed the diagnosis/symptoms of ASD, 17 % pertained to disorder management, 7 % gave an overview of the disorder as a whole, 2 % discussed the cause of ASD, and 7 % contained information classified as “other”. The majority of the videos were made by non-HCPs (86 %), while the remaining videos were made by HCPs (14 %). HCPs uploaded a significantly higher percentage of useful content (50 %) than non-HCPs (20 %, p = 0.034). HCPs also uploaded a significantly higher percentage of Diagnosis/Symptoms content (85.7 %) than non-HCPs (62 %, p = 0.015).
Conclusion
TikTok content about ASD is of unsatisfactory quality. Overall, videos are of moderate understandability, very low actionability, and are often misleading. Individuals should exercise caution when browsing the app for information about ASD, and HCPs should be aware that patients are likely to have been exposed to confusing or misleading information.}

TikTok is a social media platform that has gained popularity and become a powerful engine to disseminate public health and medical information. To date, no study has characterized the qualities of popular TikTok videos related to neurosurgery, or assessed biases in the content of these videos.
Methods
The TikTok web browser application was queried using “#neurosurgery” to identify neurosurgery-related videos. The top 100 videos meeting inclusion criteria were analyzed and video characteristics determined. Bias was assessed by the DISCERN scoring system using 3 independent reviewers. A Kruskal–Wallis H test was used to correlate video popularity with video characteristics and to correlate bias with creator and video type.
Results
The 100 videos evaluated totaled 8.8 million likes, 104,718 comments, and 100,856 shares. The oldest video was posted February 2020 and the most recent March 2022. Videos were most commonly entertaining (n = 64, 64%), and educational (n = 46, 46%). Video popularity was associated with videos that aimed to entertain, and least associated with videos depicting neurosurgery lifestyle. Low DISCERN scores, indicating more biased content, were seen across the neurosurgical content with the entertaining video category demonstrating the highest bias.
Conclusions
Neurosurgical content on TikTok contains a high degree of bias across all creator and video types. Entertaining videos are associated with the highest numbers of likes but also the greatest bias. These data may be used to guide institutions and neurosurgeons to grow interest in the field of neurosurgery and disseminate unbiased information while expanding their social media presence.}

The present study explores the sentiment surrounding the Black Lives Matter Facebook page by analyzing the comments under the video of the killing of George Floyd, posted on May 25, 2020. This examination of sentiment uses assumptions of selective exposure theory. We employed a three-pronged sentiment analysis approach and topic modeling and found an overall negative polarity in public sentiment among 7,137 Facebook comments on the video of George Floyd's death. The findings reveal a divisive response to the video which captured the death of George Floyd, which more generally suggests negative emotion in response to the Black Lives Matter movement. A sentiment test also returned a noticeably high happiness score, which might imply the widely unavoidable effects of trolls in internet discourse in the current racial context.}

We carried out a content analysis of Spanish speaking TikTok videos published between January 2022 and November 2023. We used the DISCERN instrument to assess the quality of information and classified the social norms disseminated through the videos and the narrating voices. The overall quality of information was low, with a mean DISCERN score of 29.8 out of 75. Although healthcare professionals and professional communicators performed slightly better compared to other voices, critical aspects of good health communication were often lacking; 155 videos (71%) did not mention any risk related to the use of semaglutide and only 11.9% of videos mentioned one or more serious risks. In 85% of videos, obesity was depicted as an individual problem. About half of the videos normalized the use of semaglutide and 79% of videos promoted the pharmaceuticalization of obesity by mentioning losing weight as a benefit of using semaglutide but not mentioning the need to make lifestyle changes. The combination of poor-quality health information and the promotion of potentially harmful norms related to semaglutide use is a public health concern. Further research on the commercial determinants of health in the context of semaglutide use is needed, as well as actions to mitigate the risks of misinformation and harmful health-related norms.}

Objectives
Social media plays an ever-growing part in modern life and is a frequent source of health information for patients. Singers are particularly likely to receive health information solely from fellow musicians and may experience barriers to seeking vocal healthcare. However, there have been no studies to date evaluating vocal health information on social media. Our study aimed to assess the quality, reliability, and accuracy of vocal health content on TikTok.
Study design
Cross-sectional analysis.
Methods
Three searches were carried out on TikTok, using the terms “vocal health,” “vocal injury,” and “voice tips.” The top 50 videos in each category were cataloged for extraction of data and for analysis on three discrete scales. Two independent reviewers rated each video using the Global Quality Scale (GQS), modified DISCERN scale, and Accuracy in Digital-health Instrument (ANDI).
Results
After the removal of duplicates and unavailable content, 146 videos were analyzed. The mean (range) length was 59.8 seconds (5–239), and number of views per video was 886,265 (432–36,700,000). The vast majority of videos (94.5%) were created by non-clinicians; only two videos (1.37%) were posted by otolaryngologists. The mean (SD) GQS score was 2.34 (0.75) out of a maximum of five, the DISCERN score was 0.97 (0.56) out of five, and the ANDI score was 2.85 (0.87) out of four. Video length was positively correlated with GQS and DISCERN scores, but views, likes, and shares were either not associated or negatively associated with GQS, DISCERN, and ANDI.
Conclusions
Most videos were of low quality and reliability and moderate accuracy. Measures of popularity were either uncorrelated or negatively correlated with quality, reliability, and accuracy, suggesting that TikTok users are more likely to engage with lower-quality content online. This implies a potential role for vocal health professionals to fill a crucial gap with reliable information on social media.}

Existing literature suggests that time spent on social media may be associated with increased binge eating. However, more granular details of social media experiences such as the consumption of pro-recovery content have not received sufficient scholarly attention. The present study begins to address this gap through analysis of 1074 captions from public posts on TikTok, a video-based social media platform, tagged with #BEDrecovery between July 2021–2022. We generated six themes by examining word frequencies in the data and engaging in reflexive categorization of commonly used words within the context of different posts. These themes were: (1) diets and eating approaches, (2) help and support, (3) mental health, (4) diet culture critique, (5) body monitoring, and (6) fitness. To understand which videos in the BED recovery community had the broadest reach, we also examined how themes were associated with user engagement – concretely, the number plays (times the post was watched) and shares (times users shared a link to the post with other TikTok users). Notably, we found that the number of shares was significantly lower in posts that included diet culture critique than in those that did not. By contrast plays and shares were higher in posts with body monitoring than in those without. Our findings suggest that highly engaged with #BEDrecovery TikTok content may include the promotion of diet culture and potentially create an unproductive environment for individuals seeking BED recovery support.}

This article explores TikTok's data-point ranking system to analyze how mental health rhetoric is shaped and how public health communities are formed around the term anxiety. Through a multimodal discourse analysis of the top 10 TikTok videos using the hashtag, #anxiety, this article seeks to establish how discussions of anxiety disorders are facilitated through the use of TikTok's socio-technical features and affordances of visibility, editability, persistence, and association in order to build digital communities of support. I identify recurring themes in users’ narrations of anxiety by studying in-frame content that creates meaning and contextual messages about mental health. Ultimately, these multimodal expressions of anxiety allow users to intervene and discuss often serious topics related to mental health through video, text, images, and sounds that other users can relate to and recognize. These features and affordances create networks of community and attract conversation where others can share their experiences and practices.}

This content analysis examined 200 videos from popular TikTok fitspiration hashtags (fitness, fitspo, gymtok, fittok). Two independent coders used a standardised codebook containing definitions and examples for coding. Overall, 78 % of videos showed only women, and 10 % of videos showed only men. Videos of women included both fit and thin idealised bodies, whole body and specific body part objectification, harmful themes, and promoted appearance-related reasons for exercise more frequently than videos containing men. Videos of men included muscular idealised bodies and objectification through face obscurity (excluding the face from view) more frequently than videos of women. Most videos were posted by fitness influencers, and 60 % of videos presented incorrect or harmful information. Findings suggest that fitspiration TikTok content contains characteristics known to negatively impact body image and highlights gendered differences in content themes. Further investigation is required on the promotion of appearance reasons to exercise, and the credibility of information and content creators.}

The sample comprised 189 undergraduate women (Mage = 19.25, SD = 1.98) who were randomly assigned to view one of three compilation TikTok videos on body neutrality, thin ideal, or art. Controlling for pre-test measures, results showed that women in the body neutrality group reported higher functionality appreciation and body satisfaction than women in the thin ideal and art control groups. Higher levels of positive mood and fewer upward appearance comparisons were reported by women in the body neutrality group relative to the thin ideal group. Although women in the body neutrality and thin ideal groups thought about their appearance and what they were wearing whilst viewing the videos, women in the body neutrality group reported that those thoughts were more positive than those in the thin ideal group. Findings demonstrate that brief exposure to body neutrality content on TikTok may induce immediate positive body image and mood in young women whilst providing a useful alternative to the unrealistic beauty standards popularized on such platforms.}

Since the human driver and AV systems jointly control the vehicle, responsibility is difficult to attribute. Previous research primarily investigated the blame attribution in AV crashes from an ethical or legal perspective using traditional questionnaires based on vignette-based scenarios, but reached contradictory conclusions. Public perception, as a significant source of law, is often overlooked. The research extracted 90,426 valid comments on Chinese social media platforms (Sina Weibo and TikTok) about AV crashes from April 2021 to January 2025, breaking down the limitations of traditional attribution research with novel data sources. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model exceeds other deep learning models in classification accuracy of blame attribution comments. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) results revealed an interesting topic Publicity, expanding the targets of traditional research. Regarding the topic AV system, the public appeared to have difficulty in classifying AV levels, with the highest blame volume and most negative sentiments. Importantly, we found certain connections among topics that chaotic publicity results in biased public perceptions of AV systems, thereby leading to over-trust in AV technology, which ultimately increases crash rates.}

Approximately 93% of the videos embodied Western culturally based beauty ideals somewhat or to a great extent, while 32% of the videos portrayed larger bodies. Only 32.2% of the videos contained explicit positive body image messaging, and negative appearance-focused themes or objectifying content was rare. Contradictory messaging was not present. Overall, body positive videos on TikTok rarely displayed features aligned with positive body image and promoted unrealistic beauty ideals but also rarely included explicit negative appearance-focused messaging.

This variability necessitates the development of faster, more precise, and seamless order fulfilment processes to elevate customer satisfaction and foster long-term loyalty. As a leading platform in the social livestreaming commerce sector, TikTok has implemented a merchant experience rating system, which features the Logistics Experience Score (LES) to evaluate the logistics performance of its merchants. This study aims to explore the ways in which improving the order fulfilment processes can augment the logistics performance of merchants, with a particular focus on the LES as a primary metric. The research employed a two-phase design, consisting initially of surveys (N1 = 421) and subsequently, follow-up semi-structured interviews (N2 = 21) with TikTok merchants. The outcomes from the first phase underscore the pivotal role of IT infrastructure in enhancing the ‘order receipt’ and ‘pick and pack’ stages. Concurrently, Logistics Service Quality (LSQ) profoundly influences the ‘ship and transport’ and ‘order delivery’ stages. Most notably, the ‘ship and transport’ sub-process has emerged as a critical determinant impacting the LES, thereby underscoring its significance in shaping customer perceptions of logistics services. Findings from the second phase indicate that substantial improvements in the LES can be achieved through strategic investments in IT infrastructure and forging partnerships with reliable logistics providers. Such enhancements aim to increase the speed, efficiency, and reliability of shipping and transportation. Through these findings, this research contributes to the broader understanding of order fulfilment within the context of social livestreaming commerce, providing both theoretical and empirical insights that are valuable for merchants active in this field.}

Videos with elements of physical contact (N = 16, 76.2%), violence (N = 12, 75%), and dehumanization (N = 11, 68.8%) had higher shares than overall media shares. Less than 10% of the videos included dark humor (8%), sharing helpful resources (7%), and appreciation of countries that offered support (5%). Results indicate that videos that include raising awareness (p = .02), racial discrimination (p = .001), on-scene clips or war scenes (p = .007), physical contact (p = .006), and denied entry (p = .022). Their estimated differences in locations indicate that all of these themes were related to higher median shares of the videos. This study supports that TikTok is a place where marginalized groups can raise awareness about injustice and create counternarratives. This study exemplifies international anti-blackness with implications for health marketing and communication, human rights efforts, refugee health, and targeted mental health and policy support for those displaced by war.}

We recruited 822 regular TikTok users from China through an online survey service provider and assessed their levels of depression, social anxiety, boredom proneness, distress intolerance, and problematic TikTok use severity on two assessment occasions with a two-month interval. Using structural equation modeling, we examined the associations between depression and social anxiety (time 1 predictors) with problematic TikTok use severity (time 2 dependent variable) through boredom proneness and distress intolerance (time 1 mediators). Results revealed a significant mediating effect of distress intolerance, whereas boredom proneness played no significant mediating role.

A total of 3471 posts from 2014 to 2024 were analyzed. The results show that UGC significantly outperforms BGC in terms of engagement, particularly content shared by nanoinfluencers and personal profiles, while official institutional posts recorded the lowest levels of interaction. Sentiment and emotion analysis revealed that negative sentiment and emotional tones, such as sadness and happiness, generated higher engagement than positive or neutral content. Additionally, image-based content performed better than videos, especially on the official profile. These findings emphasize the potential of UGC as a powerful tool for brand promotion in the gastronomy sector and the importance of emotional relevance in social media strategies. This dual analysis provides insights into how Catalan gastronomy is promoted and perceived online, examining the interplay between official narratives and user interactions to assess how social media shapes a cohesive and authentic gastronomic identity, with strategic implications for tourism boards and policymakers.}

abstract = {Background
TikTok is a popular social media platform that allows users to create and share content through short videos. It has become a place for everyday users, especially Generation Z users, to share experiences about their reproductive health. Owing to its growing popularity and easy accessibility, TikTok can help raise awareness for reproductive health issues as well as help destigmatize these conversations.
Objective
We aimed to identify and understand the visual, audio, and written components of content that TikTok users create about their reproductive health experiences.
Methods
A sampling framework was implemented to narrow down the analytic data set. The top 6 videos from each targeted hashtag (eg, #BirthControl, #MyBodyMyChoice, and #LoveYourself) were extracted biweekly for 16 weeks (July-November 2020). During data collection, we noted video characteristics such as captioning, music, likes, and cited sources. Qualitative content analysis was performed on the extracted videos.
Results
The top videos in each hashtag were consistent over time; for example, only 11 videos appeared in the top 6 category for #BirthControl throughout the data collection. Most videos fell into 2 primary categories: personal experiences and informational content. Among the personal experiences, people shared stories (eg, intrauterine device removal experiences), crafts (eg, painting their pill case), or humor (eg, celebrations of the arrival of their period). Dancing and demonstrations were commonly used in informational content.
Conclusions
TikTok is used to share messages on myriad reproductive health topics. Understanding users’ exposure provides important insights into their beliefs and knowledge of sexual and reproductive health. The study findings can be used to generate valuable information for teenagers and young adults, their health care providers, and their communities. Producing health messages that are both meaningful and accessible will contribute to the cocreation of critical health information for professional and personal use.}

abstract = {Financial influencers (finfluencers) are prevalent across various social media platforms, addressing a wide range of financial topics tailored to audience needs. In response to this phenomenon, this study examines the characteristics and content strategies of the top nine finfluencers on TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, with a particular focus on their potential impact on investor behavior. Employing a mixed-methods approach, this research explores eight key dimensions: finfluencer’s power, interactivity, content quality, character, collaboration, advertising strategies, content packaging, and credibility. The findings indicate that financial investment topics dominate the content landscape, with a strong emphasis on promoting specific stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other investment products. Despite their growing popularity, the study identifies a significant gap, as most finfluencers lack formal education or certification in finance, raising concerns about the dissemination of misinformation and the potential for risky investment advice. Furthermore, the analysis highlights the diverse roles assumed by finfluencers, including independent investors and traders, financial planners, and frugal living advocates. These roles significantly shape their ability to convey financial knowledge and influence the investment decisions of their audiences. This study also underscore the need for stricter regulatory oversight by financial authorities and enhanced accountability mechanisms on social media platforms, where transparency from finfluencers is crucial in ensuring ethical practices and fostering audience trust, particularly concerning financial decision-making. Finally, this research represents the first in-depth study to systematically analyse financial content on social media through a comprehensive content analysis approach.}

Rooted in Social Identity Theory and Trust Transfer Theory, this study investigates how the image transfer from the influencers to the platform and product plays a critical role in boosting online user engagement with short video endorsement content. Empirically tested with 801 TikTok users, the findings reveal that the positive image of the influencer transfers to platform and product images, and show how the platform’s positive image further enhances the positive image of the endorsed product. Notably, influencer popularity serves as a moderator, intensifying image transfer effects for highly popular influencers. These mechanisms, in turn, influence online engagement intentions and such behaviors as affection, conscious attention, social connection, and enthused participation. The study presents profound theoretical and practical implications, empowering marketers to optimize influencer strategies for success in the dynamic digital landscape.}

Employing an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the research examines how perceived ease of use, usefulness, playfulness, interactivity, immersion, and virtual reward enhance students' active learning intention. Data collected from 414 students majoring in international business across two universities in China reveal that perceived ease of use and usefulness significantly influence interactivity, while virtual rewards impact immersion and playfulness, further influencing students' active learning intention. The study developed a new scale to measure active learning intention in TikTok usage, rigorously validating its reliability and validity through pre-testing and statistical analyses. Furthermore, the research uncovers the moderating role of novelty experience in the relationship between these factors and active learning intention. The findings offer significant implications for integrating emerging technologies like TikTok into management education, highlighting the need for pedagogical strategies that leverage the unique features of social media platforms for creating and sharing short videos to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. By providing empirical evidence and a discussion of the practical implications, this research contributes to advancing the understanding of digital pedagogies in management education and encourages exploring innovative teaching methods to promote management learning in the digital era.}

With this dual-sided nature of food production, separate from policymakers, the media, scientists, and activists, how climate dialogue engagement occurs when farmers speak about climate is the interest of this research. Due to the important role of youth in climate activism, we analyze climate dialogue engagement on the youthful platform of TikTok during the most recent United Nations COP26 meeting, when climate dialogues peaked globally in the media. This study includes a two-step analyses: Step-I involved a post-focused analysis investigating digital empathy surrounding TikTok posts created by farmers. Step-II was a user-focused analysis exploring TikTok farmers’ perspectives on the public engagement with their climate-farming related posts. The results suggest that the typical empathic engagement of the analyzed climate dialogue is emotional reactions (expressed briefly or explicitly). Even though the analyzed videos contain alternative ways of communication (dynamic demonstrations, humor), cognitive empathy can differ based on the narrative and narrator. These findings contribute to studies investigating the outcome of climate communication among communities that share specific interests, elaborating on the role of alternative ways of communication in climate dialogues, and exploring how digital empathy serves to break down self-silencing among farmers and the online communities that they reach out to.}

abstract = {Background
Liver cancer incidence has been increasing in China in the recent years, leading to increased public concern regarding the burden of this disease. Short videos on liver cancer are disseminated through TikTok and Bilibili apps, which have gained popularity in recent years as an easily accessible source of health information. However, the credibility, quality, and usefulness of the information in these short videos and the professional knowledge of the individuals uploading health information–based videos in these platforms have not yet been evaluated.
Objective
Our study aims to assess the quality of the information in Chinese short videos on liver cancer shared on the TikTok and Bilibili short video–sharing platforms.
Methods
In March 2023, we assessed the top 100 Chinese short videos on liver cancer in TikTok and Bilibili (200 videos in total) for their information quality and reliability by using 2 rating tools, namely, global quality score (GQS) and the DISCERN instrument. Correlation and Poisson regression analyses were applied to discuss the factors that could impact video quality.
Results
Compared to Bilibili, TikTok is more popular, although the length of the videos on TikTok is shorter than that of the videos on Bilibili (P<.001). The quality of the short videos on liver cancer in TikTok and Bilibili was not satisfactory, with median GQS of 3 (IQR 2-4) and 2 (IQR 1-5) and median DISCERN scores of 5 (IQR 4-6) and 4 (IQR 2-7), respectively. In general, the quality of videos sourced from professional institutions and individuals was better than that of those sourced from nonprofessionals, and videos involving disease-related knowledge were of better quality than those covering news and reports. No significant differences were found in the quality of videos uploaded by individuals from different professions, with the exception of those uploaded by traditional Chinese medicine professionals, which demonstrated poorer quality. Only video shares were positively correlated with the GQS (r=0.17, P=.01), and no video variables could predict the video quality.
Conclusions
Our study shows that the quality of short videos on health information related to liver cancer is poor on Bilibili and TikTok, but videos uploaded by health care professionals can be considered reliable in terms of comprehensiveness and content quality. Thus, short videos providing medical information on TikTok and Bilibili must be carefully considered for scientific soundness by active information seekers before they make decisions on their health care management.}

abstract = {Background
As a popular social networking platform for sharing short videos, TikTok has been widely used for sharing e-cigarettes or vaping-related videos, especially among the youth.
Objective
This study aims to characterize e-cigarette or vaping-related videos and their user engagement on TikTok through descriptive analysis.
Methods
From TikTok, a total of 417 short videos, posted between October 4, 2018, and February 27, 2021, were collected using e-cigarette or vaping-related hashtags. Two human coders independently hand-coded the video category and the attitude toward vaping (provaping or antivaping) for each vaping-related video. The social media user engagement measures (eg, the comment count, like count, and share count) for each video category were compared within provaping and antivaping groups. The user accounts posting these videos were also characterized.
Results
Among 417 vaping-related TikTok videos, 387 (92.8%) were provaping, and 30 (7.2%) were antivaping videos. Among provaping TikTok videos, the most popular category is vaping tricks (n=107, 27.65%), followed by advertisement (n=85, 21.95%), customization (n=75, 19.38%), TikTok trend (n=70, 18.09%), others (n=44, 11.37%), and education (n=6, 1.55%). By comparison, videos showing the TikTok trend had significantly higher user engagement (like count per video) than other provaping videos. Antivaping videos included 15 (50%) videos with the TikTok trend, 10 (33.33%) videos on education, and 5 (16.67%) videos about others. Videos with education have a significantly lower number of likes than other antivaping videos. Most TikTok users posting vaping-related videos are personal accounts (119/203, 58.62%).
Conclusions
Vaping-related TikTok videos are dominated by provaping videos focusing on vaping tricks, advertisement, customization, and TikTok trend. Videos with the TikTok trend have higher user engagement than other video categories. Our findings provide important information on vaping-related videos shared on TikTok and their user engagement levels, which might provide valuable guidance on future policy making, such as possible restrictions on provaping videos posted on TikTok, as well as how to effectively communicate with the public about the potential health risks of vaping.}

abstract = {Background
Social media platforms like TikTok are a very popular source of information, especially for skin diseases. Topical steroid withdrawal (TSW) is a condition that is yet to be fully defined and understood. This did not stop the hashtag #topicalsteroidwithdrawal from amassing more than 600 million views on TikTok. It is of utmost importance to assess the quality and content of TikTok videos on TSW to prevent the spread of misinformation.
Objective
This study aims to assess the quality and content of the top 100 videos dedicated to the topic of TSW on TikTok.
Methods
This observational study assesses the content and quality of the top 100 videos about TSW on TikTok. A total of 3 independent scoring systems: DISCERN, Journal of the American Medical Association, and Global Quality Scale were used to assess the video quality. The content of the videos was coded by 2 reviewers and analyzed for recurrent themes and topics.
Results
This study found that only 10.0% (n=10) of the videos clearly defined what TSW is. Videos were predominantly posted by White, middle-aged, and female creators. Neither cause nor mechanism of the disease were described in the videos. The symptoms suggested itching, peeling, and dryness which resembled the symptoms of atopic dermatitis. The videos fail to mention important information regarding the use of steroids such as the reason it was initially prescribed, the name of the drug, concentration, mechanism of usage, and method of discontinuation. Management techniques varied from hydration methods approved for treatment of atopic dermatitis to treatment options without scientific evidence. Overall, the videos had immense reach with over 200 million views, 45 million likes, 90,000 comments, and 100,000 shares. Video quality was poor with an average DISCERN score of 1.63 (SD 0.56)/5. Video length, total view count, and views/day were all associated with increased quality, indicating that patients were interacting more with higher quality videos. However, videos were created exclusively by personal accounts, highlighting the absence of dermatologists on the platform to discuss this topic.
Conclusions
The videos posted on TikTok are of low quality and lack pertinent information. The content is varied and not consistent. Health care professionals, including dermatologists and residents in the field, need to be more active on the topic, to spread proper information and prevent an increase in steroid phobia. Health care professionals are encouraged to ride the wave and produce high-quality videos discussing what is known about TSW to avoid the spread of misinformation.}

To be specific, the study investigates the impact of viewers' real-time comments and streamer's dialogue on product sales and follower growth, using minute-level data for detailed analysis. The results show that real-time comments exhibit a nonlinear inverted U-shaped relationship with product sales and increment in followers. Such relationship indicates that the “overloaded comments” during live streams could cause a problem on live streaming commerce platforms. In addition, we find that streamer's dialogue has a positive effect on product sales and can mitigate the inverted U-shaped relationship between real-time comments and product sales. Furthermore, we identify that streamer's dialogue has a delayed effect on product sales, with sales typically occurring 2.5 to 5 min after the dialogue ends. The findings provide valuable guidance for optimizing the management of live streaming commerce platforms.}

abstract = {Many service systems in various type of industry provide services via chat technologies. This type of service system is characterized by an interesting combination of properties. First, the customer is actively involved in service execution, since the service is comprised of responses of the server and the customer to each other, until the customer's request is satisfied. In addition, in such a system, the service can be provided by a single server in a parallel manner to a number of customers. Motivated by these and others interesting properties of the chat service, we formulate and analyze the stochastic queueing system as a two-dimensional quasi-birth-and-death process and derive its steady-state probabilities using matrix geometric methods. By means of economic analysis, we provide a scheme for deriving the optimal capacity of parallel chats and the optimal response effort that should be made by the server, considering that higher effort lengthens the response time but increases the probability of successful service completion. We next investigate a queueing game that considers a multi-channel service system consisting of a chat service and a traditional multi-server call center, and we consider strategic customers under both a centralized and a decentralized scenario. We show that competition between service channels may lead to lower service utilization even though customers enjoy higher expected utility. Finally, customer bounded rationality is considered and it is shown that customers who are less rational may enjoy higher utility. Sensitivity analyses are conducted for all scenarios.}

A survey of U.S. parents found that greater algorithm awareness on TikTok was associated with more negative attitudes about the TikTok algorithm via the mediator of perceived TikTok risks. Parents with negative attitudes about algorithms on TikTok were more likely to prohibit their teenager from using TikTok, but algorithm awareness and attitudes were unassociated with other parental mediation strategies. This study contributes to research on digital parenting practices, suggesting that (a) perceptions of risks, not opportunities, frame the algorithm awareness process for parents and (b) algorithm awareness may operate differently than other digital skills.}

Five hundred-two valid questionnaire responses were collected from Chinese undergraduates. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) to test the hypothesis. Overall, learning anxiety has a negative effect on learning engagement, whereas learning satisfaction has a positive effect. Virtual reward has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between interaction and anxiety. Still, it positively moderates the relationship between satisfaction and learning engagement. In addition, both years of using a mobile phone and TikTok positively influence learning engagement. Collectively, the proposed model was supported and provided empirical evidence regarding the importance of user experience and product features (such as Intelligent recommendation and virtual reward) on student engagement. Implications for theories and teaching practice and limitations were discussed.}

abstract = {Short-form “What I Eat in a Day” (#WhatIEatInADay) videos are common on social media, such as on TikTok, and show a creator eating food across the assumed span of one day. There are two types of #WhatIEatInADay videos: Lifestyle, which include depictions of restrictive diets and eating disorder (ED) content, and Eating Only, which feature a creator eating excessive amounts of highly palatable food. Because viewing eating-related content with ED themes and overeating may lead to ED symptoms, we examined effects of viewing short-form #WhatIEatInADay videos on weight/shape preoccupation and urges to engage in ED behaviors. College students [N = 481; 72.3 % women, 68 % white] were randomly assigned to view Lifestyle, Eating Only, or non-eating related control (#Art) short-form videos from TikTok for 6 min. Before and after, participants rated their weight/shape preoccupation and urges to binge eat, vomit, and exercise. Mixed between-within subject ANOVAs revealed significant interactions by time and condition for weight/shape preoccupation and ED behavior urges. The Lifestyle condition reported an increase in weight/shape preoccupation and urge to exercise, and maintained urges to binge eat and vomit. Participants in the Eating Only condition reported an increase in weight/shape preoccupation and maintained urges to binge eat, vomit, and exercise. The control condition reported decreased urge to binge eat and exercise but no change in weight/shape preoccupation or urge to vomit. Effects related to change in weight/shape preoccupation in the Lifestyle condition were stronger for women. Watching short-form #WhatIEatInADay videos may elevate risk for ED cognitions and behaviors, and watching #Art videos may protect against ED risk. Further research is needed to understand moderators that may potentially strengthen the effects observed.}
