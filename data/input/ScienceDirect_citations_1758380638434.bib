abstract = {App reviews are crucial in influencing user decisions and providing essential feedback for developers to improve their products. Automating the analysis of these reviews is vital for efficient review management. While traditional machine learning (ML) models rely on basic word-based feature extraction, deep learning (DL) methods, enhanced with advanced word embeddings, have shown superior performance. This research introduces a novel aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) framework to classify app reviews based on key non-functional requirements, focusing on usability factors: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. We propose a hybrid DL model, combining BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) with BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) layers, to enhance classification accuracy. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art models demonstrates that our BERT-BiLSTM-CNN model achieves exceptional performance, with precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy of 96%, 87%, 91%, and 94%, respectively. The significant contributions of this work include a refined ABSA-based relabeling framework, the development of a high-performance classifier, and the comprehensive relabeling of the Instagram App Reviews dataset. These advancements provide valuable insights for software developers to enhance usability and drive user-centric application development.}

abstract = {Aspect based sentiment analysis(ABSA) aims to identify aspect terms in online reviews and predict their corresponding sentiment polarity. Sentiment analysis poses a challenging fine-grained task. Two typical subtasks are involved: Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) and Aspect Polarity Classification (APC). These two subtasks are usually trained discretely, which ignores the connection between ATE and APC. Concretely, we can relate ATE to APC through aspects and train them concurrently. We mainly use the ATE task as an auxiliary task, allowing the APC to focus more on relevant aspects to facilitate aspect polarity classification. In addition, previous studies have shown that utilizing dependency syntax information with a graph neural network (GNN) also contributes to the performance of the APC task. However, most studies directly input sentence dependency relations into graph neural networks without considering the influence of aspects, which do not emphasize the important dependency relationships. To address these issues, we propose a multitask learning model combining APC and ATE tasks that can extract aspect terms as well as classify aspect polarity simultaneously. Moreover, we exploit multihead attention(MHA) to associate dependency sequences with aspect extraction, which not only combines both ATE and APC tasks but also stresses the significant dependency relations, enabling the model to focus more on words closely related to aspects. According to our experiments on three benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the connection between ATE and APC can be better established by our model, which enhances aspect polarity classification performance significantly.

abstract = {The realm of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), which delves into the nuanced sentiment expressions individuals hold towards specific services or products, has demonstrated immense potential in real-world applications. Recently, ABSA has evolved into the development of aspect-based sentiment quadruple extraction (ASQP). ASQP’s objective is to predict four crucial sentiment elements: aspect, sentiment, opinion and category, where such comprehensive approach paints a holistic description of sentiment, facilitating downstream applications. However, prevailing ASQP models suffer from various limitations, such as inefficiency in decoding, inadequate handling of implicit aspects and opinions, and underutilization of structural information. In this paper, we explore an innovative approach to enhance ASQP. Firstly, we adopt a pointer-based non-autoregressive generative framework, enabling the parallel generation of all sentiment quadruples. This approach preserves the advantages of generative methods while significantly boosting decoding efficiency. Additionally, we introduce latent variable learning to model the aspect and opinion elements, effectively enhancing our ability to reason about implicit ASQP components. Furthermore, we propose an aspect-and-opinion-guided latent structure to bolster sentiment-aware context learning. This dynamically induced graph structure adapts to the specific requirements of the task, offering optimal support for ASQP. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art models on four benchmark ASQP datasets, demonstrating its significant superiority. A detailed analysis highlights the benefits of non-autoregressive decoding in achieving high inference efficiency, the effectiveness of the variational module in capturing implicit sentiment elements, and the value of the dynamically induced latent structure in accurate sentiment feature learning. Moreover, our system excels in producing interpretable predictions.}

Dialogue-level aspect-based sentiment quadruple extraction (DiaASQ) is specifically concerned with pinpointing target-aspect-opinion-emotion quadruples within conversations. DiaASQ is important in industries like e-commerce, social media analytics, and customer feedback. However, Current ABSA approaches predominantly focus on single-text scenarios, often overlooking the complexities involved in sentiment analysis within conversational contexts. To fill this gap, this paper presents the IFusionQuad model, which is specifically designed for the DiaASQ task. Our contributions include the innovative integration of CloBlock in ABSA, enhancing feature representation with context-aware weights. The InteractiveNet Fusion Module further advances dialogue understanding by aggregating dialogue-specific features such as threads, speakers, and replies. Components such as CloBlock, gating mechanism, and Biaffine attention effectively mitigate data noise issues, improving the relevance of feature extraction. Empirical evaluation on standard datasets demonstrates that the IFusionQuad model outperforms baseline methods, achieving substantial improvements in quadruple extraction. Specifically, our model shows a 6.59% increase in micro F1 and a 7.05% increase in identification F1 for Chinese datasets, and a 2.65% and 4.69% increase in micro F1 and identification F1, respectively, for English datasets. The results clearly demonstrate our IFusionQuad model’s efficacy, which consistently outperforms baseline models across all evaluation datasets on the DiaASQ task.}

However, previous studies are often constrained by coarse-grained analysis and the lack of differentiation across review rounds. Notably, the dynamic shifts in reviewers' focus and sentiment tendencies throughout multiple review stages remain underexplored. To address this gap, the present study investigates the distribution and evolution of aspect-level sentiments and examines their correlation with the number of review rounds. We begin by segmenting the multi-round review comments of 11,063 accepted papers from Nature Communications and identifying fine-grained review aspect clusters. A manually annotated corpus of approximately 5000 review sentences is then constructed. Using this dataset, we train a series of deep learning-based aspect sentiment classification models. Among them, the LCF-BERT-CDM model achieves the best performance, with a Macro-F1 score of 82.65 %. Subsequent statistical analysis reveals a consistent trend: as the number of review rounds increases, the proportion of positive sentiments rises, while negative sentiments decline. Correlation analysis further indicates that aspect sentiment scores are negatively associated with the total number of review rounds. Key aspects exhibiting stronger correlations include “experiments”, “research significance” and “result analysis”.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to conduct fine-grained sentiment analysis, necessitating the extraction of three key components: target entity, aspect category and sentiment polarity. These three components collectively form an integrated ABSA task known as TASD (Target-Aspect-Sentiment jointly Detection). Most of existing approaches on ABSA usually employ Recurrent neural networks(RNNs), Convolutional neural networks(CNNs) or pre-training models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT). However, they have some common weaknesses. First, most of the existing methods focus on one or two sub-tasks instead of triplet detection, thus they do not establish an end-to-end (training a complex learning system represented by a single model) ABSA model and cannot utilize the relevance of multiple ABSA sub-tasks during training. Second, they cannot achieve accuracy and efficiency simultaneously due to the coupling of context and given aspects. Third, they are poor in recognizing implicit targets. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel method named the Twin Towers End to End model (TTEE) to solve TASD task. It transforms complex TASD task into a simple end-to-end multi-task framework, simultaneously conducting target and aspect-sentiment detection. It builds twin towers system based on BERT or its updated versions to decouple context and given aspects, which can reduce redundant calculation to improve computational efficiency significantly. It offers great advantage to identify implicit target entity and its associated aspect-sentiment in the context without introducing extra model architecture. Experiments on three public datasets in different domains demonstrate that our approach not only achieves better performance on various evaluation metrics, but also has high efficiency in both training and inference phases, over a wide range of sample size and number of aspect categories.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) deals with understanding sentiments about specific attributes. Aspect term extraction (ATE) plays an essential role in aspect sentiment classification (ASC) by specifying the main aspects for sentiment accuracy. This paper introduces a dual-task framework for ATE and ASC models in which, the ATE model uses the imbalanced maximized-area under the curve proximate support vector machine (ImAUC-PSVM) method to mitigate the imbalance problem and the output of ATE serves as the reward in the training process of ASC supported by RL (reinforcement learning). The ImAUC-PSVM uses the conventional PSVM (proximate support vector machine) strength for sentiment tasks and the AUC (area under the curve) optimization for imbalance addressing. The ASC model employs multiple kernels for word embedding, with a transductive long short-term memory (TLSTM) for sentence representation that considers samples near the test point for better model refinement. The policy of the RL-based training strategy of the ASC model is represented by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) that categorizes sentences into positive, negative and neutral sentiments. In this RL context, aspect terms serve as rewards in the training process. The scope loss function (SLF) is also integrated within RL to rectify dataset imbalances. To optimize ATE and ASC models, an artificial bee colony (ABC) technique is incorporated for hyperparameter optimization. Experiments and evaluations conducted on English (Restaurant and Laptop) and Hindi datasets show the superiority of the proposed model over existing models of the literature. Moreover, transfer learning (TL) is applied to a Twitter dataset to assess its effect on ATE. The F-measures of the ATE model are obtained as 90.12 and 84.10 and the accuracies of the ASC model are calculated as 84.10 and 82.02 on Restaurant and Laptop datasets, respectively.}

However, fine-tuning these models needs a relatively large amount of labeled data. In this research, we propose EASE; an active learning framework to minimize manual labeling effort. We extend the active learning technique by incorporating the concept of sample diversity where similar samples are not selected for labeling. Furthermore, we maximize the utility of these samples by incorporating data augmentation. EASE was evaluated on three benchmark ABSA datasets from three different domains. The results show that the reduction of the number of needed labeled samples ranges from 88% to 94% among the three datasets while maintaining accuracy. Our results show that active learning is an effective approach to reduce manual labeling effort while maintaining comparable performance. Moreover, it is possible to reduce the number of labeled data even further by incorporating sample diversity and data augmentation while maintaining performance.}

More recently, effects of syntax-based models, applying graph convolution operation over dependency trees, are highlighted due to their superiority. However, these methods still have deficiencies. For one thing, little aspect-specific information is considered during semantic modeling of contextual words, which introduces irrelevant noise toward the aspect. For another, current syntax-based approaches either ignore the syntactic constituent knowledge, or fail to maintain the syntactic information from the reconstructed constituent tree. As such, no relation among words, phrases and clauses is built. In this work, a Semantic Enhanced Bi-Syntax Graph Convolutional Network (SEBS-GCN) is proposed to enhance semantics of context to the aspect, and capture the sentiment relevance among words, phrases and clauses. Specifically, we devise an aspect-aware gated mechanism to obtain the aspect-aware feature, based on the semantic correlations between the specific aspect and its contexts. Furthermore, the syntax information of the constituent tree is sufficiently exploited to analyze the hierarchical structure and the logical relation among words, phrases and clauses, based on which to capture the sentiment clues of the aspect.}

Recently, graph-based methods such as graph convolutional networks (GCNs), graph attention networks (GATs) and their extensions have been used to model the syntactic structures of sentences and have achieved promising results. However, these graph-based methods generally homogenize dependencies and result in the loss of syntactic information. In addition, models that use only syntax-based graph methods are unable to identify the sentiments in informal reviews. In this study, we propose a dependency feature-aware hierarchical dual-graph convolutional network (HD-GCN) model, which consists of two specifically designed GCNs for extracting syntactic and semantic information. Specifically, for semantic information extraction, we leverage a self-attention matrix to represent the correlations between nodes. For syntactic information, we design a dependency feature-aware GCN that adaptively learns the mappings of various dependencies in the adjacency matrix. Moreover, we stack the network into multiple layers, and each layer learns different relation matrices to better obtain different levels of linguistic features. Extensive experiments are conducted on the SemEval 2014 and Twitter datasets, and the obtained experimental results are superior to those of the state-of-the-art models on the ABSA task, proving the effectiveness of our model.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to predict the sentiment polarity towards given aspects in a sentence. Recent research has highlighted that graph neural networks based on syntactic dependency trees effectively convey rich syntactic information and are suitable for ABSA tasks. Most existing work typically adopt either dependency type or minimum distance between nodes in the original syntactic tree to construct different views. However, existing work overlooks the high-dimensional local feature information in dependency relations, resulting in inadequate exploration of this view. Meanwhile, most work ignores that the minimum distance view and the dependency view can be complementary and integrated in syntactic analysis. Unfortunately, directly adding the two views introduces noise issues, leading to unsatisfactory results after their integration. To address these issues, this paper introduces an integrating dual syntactic views graph convolutional network (IDSV-GCN) model that seamlessly integrates dependency type view and minimum distance view, enabling comprehensive utilization of syntactic structure and information. To better address the computation of weights in the dependency type view, we innovatively propose a fusion attention mechanism. This approach effectively captures both global and local feature information. To more effectively integrate the two views and reduce the impact of noise, we employ a syntactic mask layer to filter out noise in the dependency type view and highlighting important dependency feature information. Then, we construct a minimum distance weight matrix based on the matrix obtained from the dependency type view. Finally, we merge the two matrices and feed them into the GCN to facilitate the model’s learning of syntactic information. Experimental results on three widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed IDSV-GCN model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.}

It enables iterative learning of sentiment dependency information from contextual words to aspect terms. However, directly using syntactic dependency graphs can lead to two shortcomings. First, the long-distance sentiment information in long sentences will be weakened during GCN iterative computations. Second, the syntactic dependency graphs of short sentences lack sentiment strength information. To address these two shortcomings, we propose a Distance-Reconstructed Dependency Enhanced Sentiment analysis approach with Sentiment Strength based on GCN (DRD-SE-GCN) approach, in which the syntactic dependency graph of long sentences is reconstructed based on distance, thus narrowing the gap between sentiment words and target aspect words. It ensures that the sentiment dependency information carried by the long-distance sentiment words will not be weakened or lost during the GCN iteration. Additionally, the weights of the syntactic dependency graph for short sentences are reassigned so as to carry the strength information of sentiment words. Experimental results on four standard datasets show that our proposed model can effectively improve the accuracy of aspect-level sentiment analysis.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) provides accurate and in-depth information about users’ opinions. It has received considerable attention in recent years. Most existing research on ABSA targets extracting the aspect terms, opinion terms and sentiment polarities individually or the combinations of these roles. However, another key opinion role, i.e., opinion holder, has been ignored in these studies. The addition of an opinion holder greatly increases the complexity of the relationships between opinion roles and makes the ABSA task more challenging. In this work, we focus on extracting structured sentiment quadruples from unstructured texts. This forms a more complete picture of the sentiment information through the quadruple of the (opinion) holder, the aspect target term, the corresponding opinion term, and the expressed sentiment. We propose a boundary-sensitive token pair labeling framework (BTPL) for extracting different opinion roles and the corresponding relations in texts. This process can effectively identify the long-span roles and addresses the problem of role overlap between sentiment quadruples. Additionally, BTPL extracts four roles and their corresponding relations synchronously, which avoids error propagation encountered by existing ABSA pipeline methods. Moreover, based on syntactic dependency information, we use the conditional layer normalization module to generate high-quality representations for the candidate token pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets to verify the proposed framework. Experimental results show that the proposed BTPL achieves state-of-the-art performances.}

In recent years, graph convolutional network-based methods achieve great success for ABSA. However, previous studies ignore syntactic dependency types and aspect-related syntactic distances. Besides, effectively fusing semantic and syntactic information remains a challenging problem. Previous studies also neglect interactions between aspect terms and context. To alleviate the above problems, we develop a Multi-Information Fusion and Interaction Neural Network (MIFINN), which consists of an Aspect and Syntax-Aware Multi-Information Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (ASAMIFGCN) and a Multi-Information Interaction and Gating Network (MIIGN). The ASAMIFGCN model can integrate and fuse contextual semantics, syntactic dependency types, and aspect-related syntactic distances. Specifically, two different attentions are designed to learn global and aspect-related semantic and syntactic information, respectively. A syntactic distance gating module is proposed to acquire more precise score matrices. Besides, we propose a semantic and syntactic association module to fuse multi-information simultaneously. The MIIGN model can effectively interact aspect terms and context. Specifically, two interactive attentions are developed to learn different weights toward aspect terms and context via interactions between each other, respectively. Moreover, we propose a gating information module for controlling the information flow of aspect terms and context. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets and MIFINN achieves state-of-the-art performance. The results also demonstrate that effectively fusing and interacting multi-information can improve model performance for ABSA significantly.}

Specifically, we introduce a Text-Driven Speech Enhancement Layer that generates speech with stable timbre to identify all aspect terms, compensate for the lacking parts of visual expression, and provide additional aspect term information and emotional cues. Meanwhile, we design a semantic distance mask matrix to enhance the capability of capturing key information from the textual modality. Furthermore, a text-driven multimodal feature fusion module is incorporated to strengthen the dominant role of text and facilitate multimodal feature interaction and integration for the extraction of the term of the aspect and sentiment recognition. Comprehensive evaluations on the Twitter-2015 and Twitter-2017 benchmarks demonstrate TDSEN’s superiority, achieving absolute improvements of 2.6% and 1.7% over state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of each component.}

In DiaASQ, numerous span quadruples can be observed, where the constituent elements of these quadruples are often dispersed across a single utterance or span multiple utterances within a conversation, posing significant challenges to previous methods. In addition, existing methods typically focus on linking the target term with the opinion term, while overlooking the direct relationship between the aspect term and the opinion term, leading to inaccurate extraction of quadruples. Therefore, this paper proposes a Span-Aware framework with Relation-Augmented grid tagging scheme (SARA) to enhance DiaASQ. Specifically, a novel span-aware memory block is devised to enhance the model’s ability to obtain the long-distance dependency among elements within span quadruples. Furthermore, a new relation-augmented grid tagging scheme is introduced to strengthen the pairing of aspect terms and opinion terms, thereby enhancing the performance of quadruple extraction.

In this paper, we propose a Dual-Channel Relative Position Guided Attention Network (Dual-RPGA). Dual-RPGA deeply learns semantic and syntactic representations of sentiment to provide reliable knowledge for dynamic fusion and prediction of sentiment. First, we design a syntactic graph attention network (Syn-GAT) to learn the syntactic relative position between aspect and context, which guides the sentiment syntactic representation. Then, we build a semantic attention network (Sem-Attention). It computes semantic attention and similarity coefficients for aspects and contexts to enhance sentiment semantic expressions. Finally, we design a fusion network (Bi-Fusion) that realizes dynamic feature interactions of sentiment semantics and syntactics to perform sentiment prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on two groups of datasets to validate the performance of Dual-RPGA on the ABSA task. The results show that Dual-RPGA outperforms the optimal baseline by 0.58%∼1.49% of the Acc score, which verifies that Dual-RPGA performs better on the ABSA task.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment classification has become a popular topic in natural language processing. Exploiting dependency syntactic information with graph neural networks has recently become a popular trend. Despite their success, methods that rely heavily on a dependency tree face major challenges. This concerns the alignment of aspects and their word sentiments due to the richness of the language and the fact that a dependency tree might produce noisy signals from unrelated associations. This paper introduces a Dual-Relational Graph Attention Network (DRGAT) that fully exploits syntactic structural information and then the sentiment-aware context (e.g., phrase segmentation and hierarchical structure) of the constituent tree of a sentence. Additional constituency and dependency attention mechanisms provide comprehensive syntactic information across words, thereby enabling an accurate connection between aspect words and corresponding sentiment words. Considering that the original parsed constituency tree may have a large depth, this could lead to words being far apart increasing the computational overhead. The constituency tree of each sentence is dynamically reconstructed by determining the importance of each relational node. Extensive experimental results on six English datasets demonstrated that fully exploiting syntactic information can achieve excellent sentiment classification results.}

Recent advancements have demonstrated that the application of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to syntactic graphs yields substantial improvements in performance. However, challenges remain, including inconsistent word segmentation between Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and dependency parsers, heterogeneous embeddings for knowledge semantics, and the neglect of varying syntactic and semantic relation strengths. This paper proposes the Knowledge and Attention integrated GCN model (KA-GCN), which addresses the aforementioned issues. In particular, we propose a syntactic graph expansion algorithm to align word segmentation with PLM tokenization, thus resolving the aforementioned segmentation inconsistencies. To address the issue of heterogeneous embedding, we incorporate SentiWordNet knowledge into sentences to generate sentence-knowledge trees, and develop Knowledge-enabled RoBERTa (K-RoBERTa) for consistent encoding representations. Furthermore, we propose a position-aware attention mechanism that calculates attention scores, reflecting the strengths of syntactic and semantic relations. This mechanism also facilitates the generation of aspect-specific sentiment representations. These innovations enable KA-GCN to effectively integrate sentiment and syntactic knowledge, thereby providing an advanced approach to ABSA. Evaluation on public datasets demonstrates that KA-GCN achieves the highest performance in ABSA, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each proposed technique.}

This paper introduces a clustering and negative-sampling backed feed-forward Unsupervised Attention Deep Neural Framework for Opinion-Aspect-Category-Irrealis-Sentiment (UAN-OACIS) Quintuple extraction. This framework splits the five subtasks into two stages. In the first stage, aspects and opinions are extracted using word embedding-based multi-layer Attention Deep Neural Network (DNN) models; while the second stage projects corresponding categories, irrealis, and sentiment scores by creating a hash table and a couple of algorithms. We also propose a POS-Tag-based algorithm to make an irrealis dictionary to suggest sentiment modification percentage scores; and another algorithm to modify existing sentiment-lexicon based on domain-specific words. We compare UAN-OACIS with four unsupervised and two semi-supervised approaches at subtask level, and two supervised approaches at quadruples level excluding irrealis, and have got comparable results. Since no method is available for overall comparison at quintuple level, we additionally study the impact of irrealis on sentiment scores and observe substantial improvement compared to state-of-the-art lexicons methods.}

Existing methods frequently encounter challenges with complex sentence structures, presence of multiple sentiment quadruples, and interference from irrelevant contextual information. These challenges often result in suboptimal performance. These limitations are addressed by introducing Schrödinger equation-based adaptive dropout multi-granular feature enhancement network (SEAD-MGFE-Net), a novel framework that synergizes multigranular feature extraction with quantum-inspired adaptive regularization. The proposed methodology incorporates a multi-layer tree structure to segment sentences into semantically coherent fragments, thereby improving the alignment between aspect and opinion terms while simultaneously mitigating noise impact. Moreover, we engineer a multi-angle dynamic adjacency learning enhancement module that adeptly captures both local and global features inherent in graph-structured representations. Additionally, we devise an adaptive dropout mechanism based on the Schrödinger equation, facilitating automatic modulation of the regularization strength throughout training. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets in both Chinese and English validate the state-of-the-art effectiveness of our proposed SEAD-MGFE-Net model, achieving Micro-F1 scores of 46.53 % (Chinese) and 40.97 % (English), surpassing the strongest baseline models by 2.04 % and 1.57 %, respectively.

First, to fully harness the logical interaction flourishing within sentiment elements, a newly output template is designed for generative extraction task, which conforms to causality and human intuition. Besides, we technically introduce a grid tagging matching auxiliary task.

In this way, a comprehensive understanding of the relationships among sentiment elements is obtained. Consequently, the model’s reasoning ability is enhanced, enabling it to make more informed inferences regarding new sentiment elements based on existing ones.

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained process. Its fundamental subtasks are aspect term extraction (ATE) and aspect polarity classification (APC), and these subtasks are dependent and closely related. However, most existing works on Arabic ABSA content separately address them, assume that aspect terms are preidentified, or use a pipeline model. Pipeline solutions design different models for each task, and the output from the ATE model is used as the input to the APC model, which may result in error propagation among different steps because APC is affected by ATE error. These methods are impractical for real-world scenarios where the ATE task is the base task for APC, and its result impacts the accuracy of APC. Thus, in this study, we focused on a multi-task learning model for Arabic ATE and APC in which the model is jointly trained on two subtasks simultaneously in a single model. This paper integrates the multi-task model, namely Local Cotext Foucse-Aspect Term Extraction and Polarity classification (LCF-ATEPC) and Arabic Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (AraBERT) as a shred layer for Arabic contextual text representation. The LCF-ATEPC model is based on a multi-head self-attention and local context focus mechanism (LCF) to capture the interactive information between an aspect and its context. Moreover, data augmentation techniques are proposed based on state-of-the-art augmentation techniques (word embedding substitution with constraints and contextual embedding (AraBERT)) to increase the diversity of the training dataset. This paper examined the effect of data augmentation on the multi-task model for Arabic ABSA. Extensive experiments were conducted on the original and combined datasets (merging the original and augmented datasets). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Multi-task model outperformed existing APC techniques. Superior results were obtained by AraBERT and LCF-ATEPC with fusion layer (AR-LCF-ATEPC-Fusion) and the proposed data augmentation word embedding-based method (FastText) on the combined dataset.}

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Non-linear Aspect-based Sentiment Feature Enhancement Combined with Aspect Cross Attention (NLAFE) model, which integrates external sentiment knowledge and employs nonlinear transformation to enhance sentiment features, enabling finer-grained differentiation of polarity intensities. Additionally, an aspect cross-attention mechanism is designed to effectively integrate contextual semantic representations with aspect sentiment features, facilitating the learning of semantic associations between aspect terms and contextual words, thereby capturing the global semantic information of the input text sequence. The results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms baseline models across four benchmark datasets. Compared with models such as R-GAT, SenticGCN, and Hete_GNNs, our model achieves average improvements of 1.15 %, 1.86 %, and 2.7 % in accuracy, and 2.26 %, 2.18 %, and 4.34 % in F1 score, respectively. Moreover, the BERT-based variant, NLAFE + BERT, also shows substantial gains in both accuracy and F1 score compared to other pretrained models.}

abstract = {Numerous attempts have been made to address Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), with a predominant emphasis on English texts. Tackling ABSA in low-resource languages poses a significant challenge. Consequently, recent researchers have turned their attention to Cross-Lingual Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (XABSA). Research indicates a notable performance disparity among existing XABSA models for different sentiments, creating an evident class-imbalance issue. The class-imbalance issue is a pivotal challenge in XABSA, given the disparities not only between various sentiment categories but also between the representation distributions of the source language (SL) and the target language (TL). To bridge this gap, we present an equilibrium XABSA framework, Equi-XABSA, to alleviate the class-imbalance problem. Our framework employs a dynamic weighted loss (DWL) strategy that adaptively adjusts the model’s focus towards underperforming samples, coupled with an anti-decoupling strategy to enhance semantic integration across languages. Our approach yields an average micro F-score of 63.47 across four languages, marking the most advanced performance in the XABSA task. The experimental findings substantiate that our methodology not only surpasses current models but also effectively mitigates the XABSA class-imbalance problem.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to mine multiple sentiment–target pairs contained in a review sentence. The main challenge of this task is how to extract the sentiment polarity of a specific sentiment item efficiently. Earlier research focused on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which implicitly associate the sentiment items with sentiment polarities through an attention mechanism. However, due to the complexity of language and the fact that a sentence contains multiple sentiment pairs, these models often fail to capture sentiment pairs accurately. Most recent efforts have applied syntactic information, especially dependency information, to construct structured models (e.g., tree-based models or graph neural networks) for sentiment analysis. Although these structured models achieve better results, they ignore the domain knowledge related to the entities of the comment sentences. This domain knowledge (e.g., brand reputation, influence) significantly impacts the sentiment polarity. Hence, this paper proposes a Knowledge-aware Dependency Graph Network (KDGN) based on the dependency graph incorporating domain knowledge, dependency labels, and syntax path. Experimental results on the benchmarking datasets demonstrate that our KDGN significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on the ABSA task, further illustrating that the domain knowledge, dependency labels, and syntax path are crucial for the ABSA task.}

abstract = {Background
Accurately measuring the health care needs of patients with different diseases remains a public health challenge for health care management worldwide. There is a need for new computational methods to be able to assess the health care resources required by patients with different diseases to avoid wasting resources.
Objective
This study aimed to assessing dissatisfaction with allocation of health care resources from the perspective of patients with different diseases that can help optimize resource allocation and better achieve several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as SDG 3 (“Good Health and Well-being”). Our goal was to show the effectiveness and practicality of large language models (LLMs) in assessing the distribution of health care resources.
Methods
We used aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), which can divide textual data into several aspects for sentiment analysis. In this study, we used Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) to perform ABSA of patient reviews based on 3 aspects (patient experience, physician skills and efficiency, and infrastructure and administration)00 in which we embedded chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and compared the performance of Chinese and English LLMs on a Chinese dataset. Additionally, we used the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) application programming interface (API) to classify the sentiment analysis results into different disease categories.
Results
We evaluated the performance of the models by comparing predicted sentiments (either positive or negative) with the labels judged by human evaluators in terms of the aforementioned 3 aspects. The results showed that ChatGPT 3.5 is superior in a combination of stability, expense, and runtime considerations compared to ChatGPT-4o and Qwen-7b. The weighted total precision of our method based on the ABSA of patient reviews was 0.907, while the average accuracy of all 3 sampling methods was 0.893. Both values suggested that the model was able to achieve our objective. Using our approach, we identified that dissatisfaction is highest for sex-related diseases and lowest for circulatory diseases and that the need for better infrastructure and administration is much higher for blood-related diseases than for other diseases in China.
Conclusions
The results prove that our method with LLMs can use patient reviews and the ICD-11 classification to assess the health care needs of patients with different diseases, which can assist with resource allocation rationally.}

The MABSA technology can effectively perform Aspect Term Extraction (MATE) and Aspect Sentiment Classification (MASC) for Multimodal data. However, current MABSA work focuses on visual semantic information while neglecting the scene structure of images. Additionally, researchers using static alignment matrices cannot effectively capture complex vision features, such as spatial and action features among objects. In this paper, we propose a Vision and Language Hierarchical Alignment method (VLHA) for the MABSA task. The VLHA framework includes three modules: the multimodal structural alignment module, the multimodal semantic alignment module, and the cross-modal MABSA module. Firstly, we process the vision modality into a visual scene graph and image patches, and the text modality into a text dependency graph and word sequences. Secondly, we use the structural alignment module to achieve dynamic alignment learning between the visual scene graph and text dependency graph, and the semantic alignment module to achieve dynamic alignment learning between image patches and word sequences. Finally, we concatenate and fuse structural and semantic features in the cross-modal MABSA module. Additionally, VLHA designs a three-dimensional dynamic alignment matrix to guide the cross-attention for modal interaction learning. We conducted a series of experiments on two Twitter datasets, and the results show that the performance of the VLHA framework outperforms the baseline models. The structure of the visual modality facilitates the model in comprehensively understanding complex visual information.}

In response to these issues, this article puts forward a hybrid graph convolutional network (GCN) called SVCCL-GCN, which combines an improved variational autoencoder (VAE) and a contrastive learning module. First, construct dependency graph structures using syntactic dependency trees to obtain explicit syntactic dependency information. Then, a VAE module based on the self-attention mechanism is devised to acquire both global and local information of the data, and it is beneficial for capturing the explicit associations between aspect terms and relevant contexts to solve the long-distance dependency problems. Finally, so as to stimulate the model's capacity to flexibly learn comprehensive semantic information and emotional feature information between different words, a contrastive learning loss based on the capsule network is constructed by taking the output of the capsule network as the contrastive feature for unsupervised contrastive learning. The extensive experimental findings on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SVCCL-GCN productively improves the accuracy in distinguishing sentiment polarity.

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained text classification task, and the cutting-edge ABSA models have achieved outstanding performance. Unfortunately, the robustness of these ABSA models is neglected. ABSA models must face numerous challenges to be robust, and we concentrate on one of these challenges caused by negation words, such as “not”, “un-”. In the actual context, these negation words intuitively result in two problems: negative sensitivity and spurious correlation. First, a negation word tends to reverse the sentiment polarity of a sentence. Meanwhile, in the ABSA datasets, most sentences containing negation words express Negative polarities, which will lead the predictive model to learn the spurious correlation between negation words and polarities. To resolve these ambiguous issues, we are inspired by causal inference and propose a novel data augmentation framework, namely Pseudo Dense Counterfactual Augmentation (PDCaug) for ABSA. Specifically, we initialize a pseudo sequence and employ a multi-head multi-layer attention network to achieve counterfactual augmentation for a vanilla sentence in the hidden space. This pseudo sequence will be adversarially trained. PDCaug is a plug-and-play method for various ABSA models, so we evaluate it on discriminative models and generative prompt-based models. Our extensive experiments show that our PDCaug can significantly and consistently outperform several data augmentation methods and ABSA models.}

The traditional supervised models have achieved promising results with annotated datasets. However, their performance dramatically decreases in cross-domain aspect term extraction tasks. Existing cross-domain transfer learning methods face two common limitations: (1) these works directly inject linguistic features into language models, making it challenging to transfer linguistic knowledge to the target domain; (2) they rely on the fixed predefined prompts, which is time-consuming to construct the prompts for all potential aspect term spans. To address the limitations, we propose a soft prompt-based joint learning method for cross-domain aspect term extraction in this paper. Specifically, by incorporating external linguistic features, the proposed method learns domain-invariant representations between source and target domains via multiple objectives, which bridges the gap between domains with varied distributions of aspect terms. Furthermore, the proposed method interpolates a set of transferable soft prompts consisting of multiple learnable vectors that are beneficial to detect aspect terms in the target domain. Extensive experiments are conducted on two groups of datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for cross-domain aspect terms extraction.}

However, previous works overemphasize crafting various templates to paraphrase training targets for enhanced decoding, ignoring the internal optimizations on generative models. Despite notable results achieved by these target-oriented optimization methods, they struggle with the complicated long texts since the implicit long-distance relation, e.g., aspect-opinion relation, is difficult to extract under the position embedding mechanism in generative models. Thus, in this paper, we first clarify the causes of the problem and introduce two sequence optimization strategies: the rule-based static optimization and the score-based dynamic optimization. The rule-based approach relies on handcraft priority of dependency relation to reorder the context, while the score-based algorithm dynamically regulates the contextual sequence by calculating word position scores using neural network. Based on the dynamic optimization structure, we further propose a unified Prompt-based Generative Sequence Optimization network (named PGSO), which jointly optimizes the training target as well as the generative model. Specifically, PGSO contains two components, namely, prompt construction and sequence regulator. The former constructs a task-specific prompt based on unsupervised training objects to fully utilize the pre-trained model. The latter jointly leverages semantic, syntactic and original-sequence information to dynamically regulate contextual sequence. Our experiments conducted on four ABSA tasks across multiple benchmarks indicate that PGSO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with an average improvement of 3.52% in F1 score.}

However, traditional graph convolutional networks usually have a simpler message passing mechanism that may describe the relationship between nodes only through the adjacency matrix, often ignoring messages passed by edge features and performing sentiment analysis without considering the specific semantic information of different aspects. In this paper, we innovatively propose a syntactic and semantic enhancement network model for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ESSGKA). To be specific, we combine a self-attention mechanism with an aspect-oriented attention mechanism, enabling the simultaneous learning of aspect-related semantics and the overall semantics of the sentence. TextGINConv focuses more on edge features, which are leveraged to facilitate dense message passing. To enhance the fusion of two distinct feature messages, we propose a novel gated fusion framework based on Kolmogorov–Arnold networks. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show that our model is more competitive than state-of-the-art models.}

However, deep models generally suffer from spurious correlations between input features and output labels, which significantly hurts the robustness and generalization capability. In this paper, we propose to reduce spurious correlations for ABSA, via a novel Contrastive Variational Information Bottleneck framework (called CVIB). The proposed CVIB framework is composed of an original network and a self-pruned network, and these two networks are optimized simultaneously via contrastive learning. Concretely, we employ the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) principle to learn an informative and compressed network (self-pruned network) from the original network, which discards the superfluous patterns or spurious correlations between input features and prediction labels. Then, self-pruning contrastive learning is devised to pull together semantically similar positive pairs and push away dissimilar pairs, where the representations of the anchor learned by the original and self-pruned networks respectively are regarded as a positive pair while the representations of two different sentences within a mini-batch are treated as a negative pair. To verify the effectiveness of our CVIB method, we conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark ABSA datasets. The experimental results show that our approach achieves better performance than the strong competitors in terms of overall prediction performance, robustness, and generalization.}

Early studies applied serialization models with attention mechanisms to mine sentiment information. These models are simple and effective, but cannot accurately capture sentiment pairs when encountering complex sentences. Recently, scholars have applied dependency information to construct various graph neural networks for the ABSA task. Compared with serialized models, these structured models demonstrate the graph neural network is powerful in capturing information, and further illustrates the syntactic information is effective for sentiment analysis. However, these syntactic models are usually influenced by syntactic parsers, especially for complex sentences. Hence, this paper builds a Lexicon and Syntax Enhanced Opinion Induction Tree for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (LSOIT). Specifically, inducing knowledge-aware opinion induction trees for each aspect word applied by reinforcement learning and attention mechanisms that integrate the lexicon knowledge (i.e. sememe knowledge) and syntax knowledge (i.e. phrase structures, and dependency relationships). Finally, we establish graph neural networks on knowledge-aware opinion induction tree for ABSA. Experimental results on four benchmarking datasets (i.e., Rest14, Laptop14, Twitter and MAMS) demonstrate that LSOIT significantly improves 2.21%, 0.47%, and 0.18% on Rest14, Laptop14, and MAMS comparing with state-of-the-art models, respectively.

abstract = {Data augmentation has been widely employed in low-resource aspect-based sentiment classification (ABSC) tasks to alleviate the issue of data sparsity and enhance the performance of the model. Unlike previous data augmentation approaches that rely on back translation, synonym replacement, or generative language models such as T5, the generation power of large language models is explored rarely. Large language models like GPT-3.5-turbo are trained on extensive datasets and corpus to capture semantic and contextual relationships between words and sentences. To this end, we propose Masked Aspect Term Prediction (MATP), a novel data augmentation method that utilizes the world knowledge and powerful generative capacity of large language models to generate new aspect terms via word masking. By incorporating AI feedback from large language models, MATP increases the diversity and richness of aspect terms. Experimental results on the ABSC datasets with BERT as the backbone model show that the introduction of new augmented datasets leads to significant improvements over baseline models, validating the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation strategy that combines AI feedback.}

abstract = {Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) involves determining sentiment polarity in sentences concerning specific aspects. Recent approaches in ABSA have incorporated dependency parsing to gain a deeper understanding of word associations within aspect-related terms. Nevertheless, these models typically concentrate solely on dependency connections while neglecting their specific characteristics or types. This can lead to sentiment inconsistencies, particularly when analyzing sentences with multiple aspects and diverse polarities. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative solution known as Aspect-specific Parsimonious Segmentation via Attention-based Graph Convolutional Network (APSA-GCN) for ABSA. Our model consists of two key modules that harness a variety of features, including syntax, semantics, and lexicon-based representations. The aspect-specific parsimonious segmentation framework segments the data and directs it to parsimonious dual filters, retaining only aspect-specific sentences called explicit data for lexicon-based representation. Subsequently, the Attention-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is employed to extract syntactic and semantic features more explicitly, thereby enriching the representation of aspect-related features. Extensive experiments were conducted on various benchmark datasets, and the results confirm the model’s efficacy as our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our introduced APS framework can be effortlessly incorporated into other benchmark models to enhance the outcomes of ABSA.}

Although ABSA is essential to enrich a thorough understanding of customer behavior, applying it to hospitality and tourism management is challenging because matching sentiment valence with an aspect category is complicated, and annotated datasets are scarce. The ZSTC suggested by this study leverages pre-trained large language models and addresses these challenges in hospitality and tourism management contexts. Furthermore, impact-asymmetry analysis based on the Kano model investigates the asymmetric relationships between the identified aspects and customer satisfaction. It classifies them into satisfiers, dissatisfiers, or hybrids and prioritizes them to support managerial decision-making. A case study analyzing TripAdvisor reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic is provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology.

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) endeavours predict the sentiment polarity of specific aspects of a given review. Recently, prompt tuning has been widely explored and has achieved remarkable success in improving semantic comprehension in several NLP tasks. However, most existing methods consider semantic tuning for various tasks and overlook domain knowledge, such as common-sense background knowledge. This not only limits the model’s ability to understand and apply domain knowledge but also often leads to the model’s inability to fully utilise domain-specific information, resulting in poor semantic quality and inferior model performance. To bridge this gap, we conducted a systematic study of Prompt Tuning with Domain Knowledge (PTDK) for ABSA, which aimed to design efficient prompts that guide the model to learn the knowledge of specific aspects in ABSA. Specifically, we first fine-tune the Large Language Models (LLMs) using hard prompts, which enhance the ability to extract enriched domain insights from the knowledge base. Additionally, we employed a Co-occurrence Gate to meticulously filter and refine the domain knowledge. This mechanism enhances the domain representation capability of the prompt template by selecting the most similar parts that are independently generated from a vast amount of domain knowledge for each comment. Simultaneously, a emphhybrid prompt templatewas constructed. This template integrates hard prompts and trainable soft prompts to compensate for the lack of specificity in hard prompts and to facilitate the integration of specific masks in various domain vectors. This hybrid strategy further enhances our ability to utilise domain-specific knowledge when performing ABSA. Experimental results on three public datasets – Restaurant, Laptop, and Twitter – demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art baselines in all cases. The accuracies were 88.63%, 82.65%, and 81.65%, respectively, and F1-scores were 83.38%, 79.68%, and 80.36%, respectively. This translates into an average increase in accuracy of 0.97% and an enhancement in the F1-score of 1.03%. These enhancements not only validate the efficacy of our approach but also have substantial practical implications for real-world scenarios that require sophisticated sentiment analysis, such as the evaluation of customer feedback on e-commerce platforms.}

Despite the constraints of syntactic-based relation rules, rule-based approaches can be domain-independently implemented. Although supervised approaches yield better results, more costly due to requiring a large number of labeled samples. This study proposes an unsupervised (rule-based) OTE approach with novel methods and extended rule-based techniques to overcome the aforementioned issues. In this study, first, a novel pattern-based text pre-processing method is proposed to eliminate punctuations that are incompatible with determinative group rules patterns. Then, implemented syntactic-based relation rules on the dependency relation graph are extended with new auxiliary features to extract multi-word expressions which modify each other. The majority voting method is used for optimizing the performance of outputs. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach was tested on a restaurant review dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms all unsupervised approaches. Additionally, it gives comparable results with the supervised approaches, revealing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

In this paper a method for ABSA that employs both syntax and semantic information and incorporates dependency parsing(Semantic-Syntactic Dependency Parsing (SSDP) Method) with Core Natural Language Processing (CoreNLP) which is a natural language processing library for processing the input text and identifying patterns effectively (according to the CoreNLP relations and part of speech tagging(POS)) to extract the critical relations that accurately reflect the sentiment conveyed regarding the opinion target is proposed.

We illustrated the efficacy of SSDP, through experiments on the SemEval14,Semval15 and Semval16 datasets, which include two datasets (laptops and restaurants) carefully categorized by a human annotator into categories of positive, negative, or neutral attitudes. The experimental results reveal that SSDP is superior to the other state-of-the-art ABSA approaches, that use syntax information but do not utilize data processing techniques.

However, collecting such fine-grained training samples is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore the available ABSA training samples are often scarce. To break the data scarcity challenge of ABSA, we investigate semi-supervised aspect-based sentiment analysis (SemiABSA), which trains ABSA models using a limited amount of expensive labeled sentences and more unlabeled-yet-cheaper sentences. We propose a novel SemiABSA framework, namely semi-supervised aspect-based sentiment analysis with masked aspect prediction (S3 map), built on the self-training paradigm. We form pseudo-aspect words and pseudo-sentiment polarities for unlabeled sentences and improve model training. Specifically, a BERT-encoder-based masked aspect prediction (MAP) task achieves the pseudo-aspect words generation. Based on S3 map, we thoroughly investigate the potential of SemiABSA from various perspectives. The empirical results show that S3 map can consistently improve performance by leveraging unlabeled sentences, even those from different domains.}

However, such settings are neither practical nor appropriate in real-life applications, as aspects must be extracted prior to sentiment classification. This study aims to overcome this shortcoming by jointly identifying aspect terms and the corresponding sentiments using a multi-task learning approach based on a unified tagging scheme. The proposed model uses the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to produce the input representations, followed by a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layer for further contextual and semantic coding. An attention layer is added on top of BiGRU to force the model to focus on the important parts of the sentence. Finally, a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) layer is used to handle inter-label dependencies. Experiments conducted on a reference Arabic hotel dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the baseline and related work models.}

However, this approach is insensitive to syntactic structural information and susceptible to noise interference. Existing fusion methods are unable to effectively capture the complementary relationships between information, leading to large and less efficient model structures. To tackle these issues, we introduce a unique and original scheme that fuses semantic information, ConceptNet conceptual knowledge, and SenticNet affective knowledge, intending to improve the capability of the model to capture sentence features. Specifically, the process involves four steps: first, a semantic attention mechanism is constructed as the first channel to parse the semantic relationship within the context; second, the expressive meaning of the aspects is enhanced with concept mapping as the second channel, with concepts injected into aspectual words; third, the representation ability of sentence dependency graphs is strengthened through adding the affective knowledge of SenticNet as a third channel. Subsequently, the sensitivity of the model to affective information is increased, and finally, the optimization of aspect and context coordination is strengthened by integrating an interactive attention mechanism. The overall findings underscore the efficacy of the model, showing accuracy improvements of 1.05 % and 2.80 % on the Twitter and Lap14 datasets, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art models. Moreover the macro-F1 scores showed significant improvements of 1.99 % and 1.61 %, respectively, enabling more effective capturing of aspect-specific sentiment expressions.}

In this paper, we present and compare two commonly used contrastive learning approaches for enhancing ABSA performance: sentiment-based supervised contrastive learning and augmentation-based unsupervised contrastive learning. Sentiment-based supervised contrastive learning employs sentiment labels to distinguish between positive and negative samples. Augmentation-based unsupervised contrastive learning aims to utilize various data augmentation strategies to generate positive samples.

Moreover, when a text contains multiple emotional dimensions, these dimensions can interact, complicating the judgments of emotional polarity. In response to these challenges, this study proposes an innovative training framework: Linking words-guided multidimensional emotional data augmentation and adversarial contrastive training (LWEDA-ACT). Specifically, this method alleviates the issue of data scarcity by synthesizing additional training samples using four different text generators. To obtain the most representative samples, we selected them by calculating sentence entropy. Meanwhile, to reduce potential noise, we introduced linking words to ensure text coherence. Additionally, by applying adversarial training, the model is able to learn generalized feature representations to handle minor input perturbations, thereby enhancing its robustness and accuracy in complex emotional dimension interactions. Through contrastive learning, we constructed positive and negative sample pairs, enabling the model to more accurately identify and distinguish the sentiment polarity of different aspect terms. We conducted comprehensive experiments on three popular ABSA datasets, namely Restaurant, Laptop, and Twitter, and compared our method against the current state-of-the-art techniques.

The main part of this task is to develop the novel ABSA concerning both explicit and implicit aspects using demonetization dataset reviews from India. Initially, the pre-processing of online tweets is performed by stop word removal, tokenization, lower case conversion, and stemming. Further, the explicit aspects are extracted, as it is simple to extract from the sentence and the polarity score is computed. A machine learning algorithm termed as Neural Network (NN) is utilized that helps for training the data regarding the implicit aspects, and further, helps to differentiate properly for the testing data with exact polarity score. Optimal feature selection is performed using the Self Adaptive Beetle Swarm Optimization (SA-BSO). These optimal features are given to a deep structured architecture called Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with hidden neuron optimization by SA-BSO, which categorizes the demonetization reviews into positive, negative, or neutral. While taking the findings, the accuracy of the offered SA-BSO-RNN is secured at 4.67%, 6.56%, 3.54%, and 7.12% progressed than PSO-RNN, FF-RNN, CSA-RNN, and BSO-RNN, at 3-fold analysis for dataset 1.

This model incorporates external knowledge through a contextual supplement strategy to overcome the limitations of traditional methods. It deeply understands the emotional context of a text. We also introduce a mutual information-maximized feature interaction method. It optimizes the mutual information between the outputs of a reaction and effect-integrated graph convolutional network and a hierarchical and position-aware graph convolutional network to capture the correlations between features from different sources. Furthermore, we propose a specially designed prompt template to understand contextual semantic information better when predicting aspect terms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HPEP-GCN model achieves the best results on the SemEval 14–16 datasets, improving the accuracy scores by 0.07–2.22% compared to baseline models.}

This approach enables the identification of relevant topics, categorizing IDF scores based on occurrence frequencies. Scores ranging between 4–6 are marked as having low value but high informative potential, making them suitable candidates for label-specific datasets, particularly those without pre-existing labels.

abstract = {Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is crucial for in-depth mining and analysis of opinion expressions and sentiment tendencies in massive user review texts. Most of the existing researches on ABSA in Chinese only consider a single contextual semantic feature, while ignoring syntactic dependency feature, and rarely addresses the realization of multiple tasks in the same model. From the perspective of multi-task unification, this paper proposes a multi-task unified model for Chinese aspect-based sentiment analysis (MTUC-ABSA), which integrates Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn multiple features between context and sentiment elements, and uses the unified Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) paradigm to build a multi-task model, which mainly focuses on the aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) task. Experimental results on real data sets show that our method can effectively improve the accuracy of aspect-based sentiment analysis compared with other existing methods.}

Although previous research has demonstrated that syntax knowledge can be beneficial for E2E-ABSA, standard syntax dependency parsing struggles to capture the block-level relation between aspect and opinion terms, which hinders the role of syntax in E2E-ABSA. To address this issue, this paper proposes a block-level dependency syntax parsing (BDEP) based model to enhance the performance of E2E-ABSA. BDEP is constructed by incorporating routine dependency syntax parsing and part-of-speech tagging, which enables the capture of block-level relations. Subsequently. the BDEP-guided interactive attention module (BDEP-IAM) is used to obtain the aspect-aware representation of each word. Finally the adaptive fusion module is leveraged to combine the semantic-syntactic representation to simultaneously extract the aspect term and identify aspect-orient sentiment polarity. The model is evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including Laptop14, Rest _ALL, Restaurant14, Restaurant15, and TWITTER, with F1 scores of 62.67%, 76.53%, 75.42%, 62.21%, and 58.03%, respectively. The results show that our model outperforms the other compared state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all datasets. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the efficacy of BDEP and IAM in improving aspect-level sentiment analysis.}

However, individual reviews often contain multiple conditions and coordinating and conflicting elements or relationships, which significantly increases the complexity of this task. In recent years, exploiting semantic–syntactic information with graph neural networks has been widely used to address such tasks. However, such methods overlook the features of the location influence factor of words and may provide irrelevant or even interfering noisy signals for ABSA because of the word association relationships mined by the syntax tree and semantic composition tree. To alleviate the effect of noise information and fully strengthen the context for multiple-aspect representation in ABSA, we propose a new framework, PSA-GAT, that mines information on position importance, syntactic–semantic dependencies and cross-aspect correlations. Overall, the structural features of the multi-aspect sentiment set are learned by using various variations of graph neural networks. Moreover, the experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PSA-GAT compared to state-of-the-art methods.

To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a fake review detection model using aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) while considering the effects of product types. Using a dataset of Amazon reviews, our ABSA model revealed that two aspects are fundamental for detecting fake reviews and suggests the need to associate the two.

This approach combines syntactic dependency trees with aspect-specific relational graph structures derived from Large Language Models (LLMs) like Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, preserving global syntactic information and enriching local aspect-specific information. Our method computes the number of paths between nodes using the dependency tree’s adjacency matrix and augments this with the syntactic relations from the reconstructed relational graph.

However, these models often struggle with losing or forgetting implicit feature information from shallow and intermediate layers during the learning process, potentially compromising classification performance. We consider the implicit feature information in each layer of the model to be equally important for processing. So, this paper proposes the CABiLSTM-BERT model, which aims to fully leverage implicit features at each layer to address this information loss problem and improve accuracy. The CABiLSTM-BERT model employs a frozen BERT pre-trained model to extract text word vector features, reducing overfitting and accelerating training. These word vectors are then processed through CABiLSTM, which preserves implicit feature representations of input sequences and LSTMs in each direction and layer. The model applies convolution to merge all features into a set of embedding representations after highlighting important features through multi-head self-attention calculations for each feature group. This approach minimizes information loss and maximizes utilization of important implicit feature information at each layer. Finally, the feature representations undergo average pooling before passing through the sentiment classification layer for polarity prediction. The effectiveness of the CABiLSTM-BERT model is validated using five publicly available real-world datasets and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and Macro-F1. Results demonstrate the model's efficacy in addressing ABSA tasks.}

Comprehending multi-modal sentiment expression requires strong cross-modal alignment and fusion ability.

We present CoolNet (Cross-modal Fine-grained Alignment and Fusion Network) to boost the performance of visual-language models in seamlessly integrating vision and language information. Specifically, CoolNet starts by transforming an image into a textual caption and a graph structure, then dynamically aligns the semantic and syntactic information from both the input sentence and the generated caption, as well as models the object-level visual features. Finally, a cross-modal transformer is employed to fuse and model the inter-modality dynamics.This network boasts advanced cross-modal fine-grained alignment and fusion capabilities. On standard benchmarks such as Twitter-2015 and Twitter-2017, CoolNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithm FITE with notable improvements in accuracy and Macro-F1 values. Specifically, we observe an improvement in accuracy and Macro-F1 values by 1.43% and 1.38% for Twitter-2015, and 0.74% and 0.88% for Twitter-2017, respectively, demonstrating the superiority of our CoolNet architecture.}

The virtual edges are decided by the association intensity between the aspect and the words of the sentence.

Existing ABSA methods have achieved impressive predictive performance by not only leveraging attention mechanism to capture semantic association information within sentences, but also employing graph convolutional network (GCN) to exploit the syntactic structure information of dependency and constituency trees. However, these methods still have two main shortcomings: (1) they overlook the utilization of local sentiment features in the constituency tree, focusing only on global sentiment features; and (2) they fail to comprehensively utilize the syntactic information from both dependency and constituency trees. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-granularity graph convolutional network (MGCN), which comprises three main components: an attention layer, a mask matrix layer, and a GCN layer. In the attention layer, we constructed semantic association matrices using an attention mechanism to explore the semantic associations between words and overall sentence semantics. In the mask matrix layer, we designed hierarchical rule-based multi-granularity constituency tree mask matrices (CM) to extract sentiment features from local to global levels within the constituency tree. Additionally, to obtain a more comprehensive syntactic features set, we fully fused the structural characteristics of the dependency and constituency trees to create multi-granularity fusion mask matrices (FM), which were further enhanced by the semantic association matrices. Finally, in the GCN layer, we performed convolution operations on the enhanced FM to strengthen the node representations. Experiments on the SemEval 2014 and Twitter datasets demonstrated effectiveness of MGCN.}

In this research, we introduce a novel Graph Augmentation Networks Based on Dynamic Sentiment Knowledge and Static External Knowledge Graphs (DSSK-GAN), which utilizes both dynamic and static external knowledge to aid in modeling the relationship between aspect words and their associated sentiment words. Specifically, DSSK-GAN is engineered to effectively capture and integrate information from three perspectives of representation (i.e., syntactic representation with dynamically updated sentiment nodes, semantic representation based on self-attention mechanism, and knowledge graph representation). Firstly, we have designed and developed the Bifold-GCN module, a two-channel graph encoder. A globally shared and dynamically updated sentiment enhancement matrix is used to feed the DS-SGCN to obtain the representation T1. The semantic representation T2 is produced by Sem-GCN using multi-head self-attention. Secondly, the knowledge graph embedding is concatenated with the output of Bi-LSTM to obtain the knowledge representation T3 using the aspect knowledge focus mechanism. Finally, we propose a local gating-global convolution module to fuse the representations of the three perspectives. Furthermore, we incorporate an extra mission for sentiment word categorization to enhance the model’s attention towards sentiment terms. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five publicly available ABSA datasets. The obtained findings demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed DSSK-GAN model.}

To address these issues, we design a Multi-Axis Fusion network with Optimal Transport learning (MAFOT) for multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis, which introduces the optimal transport kernel embedding (OTKE) to realize unimodal input feature transformation and the multi-axis fusion module (MAFM) to perform multimodal feature fusion from horizontal, vertical, and channel directions. Specifically, we utilize the pre-trained models to obtain unimodal feature representations (e.g., sentences, opinion aspects, and associated images). Subsequently, we use the optimal transport kernel method to embed the heterogeneous unimodal features into public subspaces, which have non-linear transformation capabilities that can reduce the representation gap. Then, the multi-axis fusion module is designed to integrate multimodal information, which is processed from different axes using a multilayer perceptrons learner. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly datasets demonstrate that the proposed model MAFOT is more competitive against the SOTA baseline models.}

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-layer fusion model (MLFM) based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to efficiently fuse semantic and syntactic information for sentiment analysis. In the model, we first propose a new bi-graph convolutional network module for aspect term-centered aspect nodal attention (Aspect-NA) to enhance Semantic and Syntactic learning. Within Aspect-NA, we introduce dependency embedding and propose a dual embedding update mechanism that pays more attention to the influence of dependency types and semantics. In addition, we propose an adaptive hierarchical cross-attention (AHCA) for fusing the semantic information of aspect term with their associated syntactic features. AHCA not only effectively fuses features between syntax and semantics of the context, but also carries out the key features.

Besides, some works focused on learning the dependency information or the external knowledge-enhanced dependency information separately, which lacked the exploitation of the mutual interaction between the normal dependency and knowledge-enhanced dependency. Therefore, we propose a novel ABSA method namely prompted representation joint contrastive learning enhanced graph convolutional networks (PRCL-GCN) to strengthen the robustness of the ABSA model. Specifically, to achieve the task-oriented contextual representation, we design the task-specific prompt template to guide the fine-tuning process of PLM in the ABSA task. And a biaffine attention mechanism is employed to further extract the essential sentiment feature from the prompted representation. Moreover, we introduce the syntax dependency graph as prior knowledge, and construct an affective syntactic dependency graph by injecting the affective knowledge from SenticNet into the graph. Then, we utilize the multi-layer GCNs to process the above two syntactic graphs independently, which aims to learn multi-granularity syntactic features. Subsequently, a novel designed attention variant is leveraged to integrate these syntax features with the guided contextual representation, separately. Eventually, through designing a Kullback–Leibler divergence-based contrastive learning to encourage the model’s learning, we improve the model’s accuracy in modeling contextual representation by integrating the designed dual-ways information. Extensive experiments are conducted on five benchmark datasets, and the outstanding experiment results validate the effectiveness of our proposed model.}

Most previous work in Arabic has been based on regular methods of machine learning that mainly depends on a group of rare resources and tools for analyzing and processing Arabic content such as lexicons, but the lack of those resources presents another challenge. In order to address these challenges, Deep Learning (DL)-based methods are proposed using two models based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) neural networks for ABSA. The first is a DL model that takes advantage of word and character representations by combining bidirectional GRU, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Conditional Random Field (CRF) making up the (BGRU-CNN-CRF) model to extract the main opinionated aspects (OTE). The second is an interactive attention network based on bidirectional GRU (IAN-BGRU) to identify sentiment polarity toward extracted aspects. We evaluated our models using the benchmarked Arabic hotel reviews dataset. The results indicate that the proposed methods are better than baseline research on both tasks having 39.7% enhancement in F1-score for opinion target extraction (T2) and 7.58% in accuracy for aspect-based sentiment polarity classification (T3).

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task that focuses on understanding opinions at the aspect level, including sentiment towards specific aspect terms, categories, and opinions. While ABSA research has seen significant progress, much of the focus has been on monolingual settings. Cross-lingual ABSA, which aims to transfer knowledge from resource-rich languages (such as English) to low-resource languages, remains an under-explored area, with no systematic review of the field. This paper aims to fill that gap by providing a comprehensive survey of cross-lingual ABSA. We summarize key ABSA tasks, including aspect term extraction, aspect sentiment classification, and compound tasks involving multiple sentiment elements. Additionally, we review the datasets, modelling paradigms, and cross-lingual transfer methods used to solve these tasks. We also examine how existing work in monolingual and multilingual ABSA, as well as ABSA with LLMs, contributes to the development of cross-lingual ABSA. Finally, we highlight the main challenges and suggest directions for future research to advance cross-lingual ABSA systems.}

abstract = {As a key task of fine-grained sentiment analysis, aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to analyse people’s opinions at the aspect level from user-generated texts. Various sub-tasks have been defined according to different scenarios, extracting aspect terms, opinion terms, and the corresponding sentiment. However, most existing studies merely focus on a specific sub-task or a subset of sub-tasks, having many complicated models designed and developed. This hinders the practical applications of aspect-based sentiment analysis. Therefore, some unified frameworks are proposed to handle all the subtasks, but most of them suffer from two limitations. First, the syntactic features are neglected, but such features have been proven effective for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Second, very few efficient mechanisms are developed to leverage important syntactic features, e.g., dependency relations, dependency relation types, and part-of-speech tags. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel unified framework to handle all defined sub-tasks for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Specifically, based on the graph convolutional network, a multi-layer semantic model is designed to capture the semantic relations between aspect and opinion terms. Moreover, a multi-layer syntax model is proposed to learn explicit dependency relations from different layers. To facilitate the sub-tasks, the learned semantic features are propagated to the syntax model with better semantic guidance to learn the syntactic representations comprehensively. Different from the conventional syntactic model, the proposed framework introduces two attention mechanisms. One is to model dependency relation and type, and the other is to encode part-of-speech tags for detecting aspect and opinion term boundaries. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed novel unified framework, and the experimental results on four groups of real-world datasets explicitly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over a range of baselines.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to analyze the sentiment polarity of a given text towards several specific aspects. For implementing the ABSA, one way is to convert the original problem into a sentence semantic matching task, using pre-trained language models, such as BERT. However, for such a task, the intra- and inter-semantic relations among input sentence pairs are often not considered. Specifically, the semantic information and guidance of relations revealed in the labels, such as positive, negative and neutral, have not been completely exploited. To address this issue, we introduce a self-supervised sentence pair relation classification task and propose a model named Multi-level Semantic Relation-enhanced Learning Network (MSRL-Net) for ABSA. In MSRL-Net, after recasting the original ABSA task as a sentence semantic matching task, word dependency relations and word-sentence relations are utilized to enhance the word-level semantic representation for the sentence semantic matching task, while sentence semantic relations and sentence pairs relations are utilized to enhance the sentence-level semantic representation for sentence pair relation classification. Empirical experiments on SemEval 2014 Task 4, SemEval 2016 Task 5 and SentiHood show that MSRL-Net significantly outperforms other baselines such as BERT in terms of accuracy, Macro-F1 and AUC.}

abstract = {In the realm of natural language processing (NLP), aspect-based sentiment analysis plays a pivotal role. Recently, there has been a growing emphasis on techniques leveraging Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN). However, there are several challenges associated with current approaches: (1) Due to the inherent transitivity of CGN, training inevitably entails the acquisition of irrelevant semantic information. (2) Existing methodologies heavily depend on the dependency tree, neglecting to consider the contextual structure of the sentence. (3) Another limitation of the majority of methods is their failure to account for the interactions occurring between different aspects. In this study, we propose a Clause Graph Transformer Structure (CGT) to alleviate these limitations. Specifically, CGT comprises three modules. The preprocessing module extracts aspect clauses from each sentence by bi-directionally traversing the constituent tree, reducing reliance on syntax trees and extracting semantic information from the perspective of clauses. Additionally, we assert that a word’s vector direction signifies its underlying attitude in the semantic space, a feature often overlooked in recent research. Without the necessity for additional parameters, we introduce the Clause Attention encoder (CA-encoder) to the clause module to effectively capture the directed cross-correlation coefficient between the clause and the target aspect. To enhance the representation of the target component, we propose capturing the connections between various aspects. In the inter-aspect module, we intricately design a Balanced Attention encoder (BA-encoder) that forms an aspect sequence by navigating the extracted phrase tree. To effectively capture the emotion of implicit components, we introduce a Top-K Attention Graph Convolutional Network (KA-GCN). Our proposed method has showcased state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance through experiments conducted on four widely used datasets. Furthermore, our model demonstrates a significant improvement in the robustness of datasets subjected to disturbances.}

ABSA divides the overall review sentiment of each online review into five categories, namely location, tastiness, price, service, and atmosphere. By employing the machine learning–based conditional survival forest model, empirical results show that compared with overall review sentiment, aspect-based sentiment for various factors can improve the prediction performance of restaurant survival. Based on feature importance analysis, this study also highlights the effects of different types of aspect sentiment on restaurant survival prediction to identify which features of online reviews are optimal indicators of restaurant survival.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to extract fine-grained sentiment information for different aspects in a review sentence. While existing methods have explored various ways to model the relationships between aspect terms and context, they often overlook the sentiment connection between aspect terms and the sentiment expressed by the review sentence itself. The sentiment tone of the sentence typically reflects the reviewer’s preferences and focus on certain aspects. Capturing this sentiment relationship allows the model to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the reviewer’s emotional experience and attitude. In this paper, we propose an information-assisted and sentiment relation-driven multitask learning network (IASD-ML) to address this gap. We define and label the relationship between aspect polarity and sentence polarity, treating it as an auxiliary task to learn the reviewer’s emotional context and the emotional associations between aspects and sentences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to extract the sentiment relationship between aspect terms and sentence sentiment as an auxiliary classification task. Furthermore, relying solely on coarse-grained emotional cues from context is often insufficient to fully capture semantic and implicit relationships. To address this, we incorporate external commonsense path information to assist in extracting fine-grained sentiment cues and background information. Specifically, we use an external sentiment lexicon to label emotional words in the sentence, treating aspect terms as head entities and emotional words as tail entities, and retrieve commonsense path information from the ConceptNet knowledge base. By combining word dependencies with commonsense path information, we construct a commonsense aware graph network to further strengthen the emotional connections between aspect terms and sentiment words. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach has a solid competitive advantage.}

Existing domain adaptation approaches either focus on acquiring domain-independent shared feature representations or adjusting the obtained feature distribution to the target domain, which fails to address critical domain-specific attributes, leading to misaligned feature representations. We propose a large language model augmented syntax-aware domain adaptation method that integrates advanced large language models with structured syntactic knowledge to recognize semantic attributes and address the lack of syntax sensitivity in large language models. A domain topic predictor based on adversarial training is developed to enhance the robustness and generalization of the framework across different domains. Additionally, automatic soft prompt learning is conducted based on analysed domain topics and task-relevant feature representations for domain-specific fine-tuning, aiding the architecture in conveying domain-specific semantic information in the cross-domain environment. The feature aggregation approach dynamically fuses six categories of analysed feature representations for fine-grained sentiment classification. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the pioneering effort to systematically leverage syntactic and cross-domain characteristics to enhance pre-trained large language models in addressing cross-domain aspect-based sentiment analysis tasks. Experimental results on publicly available benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.}

In general, the syntactic dependency and semantic information between aspects and their contexts are modeled using deep neural networks. However, most of the existing methods treat specific aspects in a sentence independently, while ignoring the sentiment relationships between multiple aspects. In this work, we propose an Aspect-Pair Supervised Contrastive Learning (APSCL) model to capture the latent relationships between multiple aspects in the sentiment subspace. Through experiments, we approve that in the embedding space, the representation discrepancy of aspect-pairs in the same relation category is narrowed while the embedding representation of aspect-pairs in different relation categories is pushed away. Then the aspect feature representation is enhanced through the relationship optimization between aspects. Furthermore, the relation categories between aspects are established in terms of the existing label attributes of aspects, and no additional corpus is needed. The extensive experiments on public datasets SemEval 2014 and MAMs show that the proposed framework APSCL is able to improve up to 2.29% on accuracy and 4.18% on F1 score over top-1 baseline models. Moreover, our framework can also be adapted to other benchmark models.}

ABSA focuses on unveiling the sentiment orientation associated with specific entities or attributes within textual data, resulting in a more precise depiction of intricate emotional nuances. However, due to the extensive range of applications for ABSA, certain domains face challenges such as constrained dataset sizes and the absence of exhaustive, high-quality corpora, leading to issues like few-shot learning and resource scarcity scenarios. To address the issue of limited training dataset sizes, one viable approach involves the utilization of text-based context generation to expand the dataset. In this study, we amalgamate Bert-based text generation with text filtering algorithms to formulate our model. Our model fully leverages contextual information using the Bert model, with a particular emphasis on the interrelationships between sentences. This approach effectively integrates the relationships between sentences and labels, resulting in the creation of an initial data augmentation corpus. Subsequently, filtering algorithms have been devised to enhance the quality of the initial augmentation corpus by eliminating low-quality generated data, ultimately yielding the final text-enhanced dataset. Experimental findings on the Semeval-2014 Laptop and Restaurant datasets demonstrate that the enhanced dataset enhances text quality and markedly boosts the performance of models for aspect-level sentiment classification.}

This limitation hinders their ability to assist the model in perceiving aspects-sentiments in different domains. To overcome this challenge, we present a cross-domain ABSA approach based on simplified syntactic-guided representation learning. Initially, we design a dependency syntax simplification strategy that unifies syntactic labels of aspect terms and their corresponding opinion terms. We employ these simplified syntactic labels to guide the model's self-supervised learning process, thereby obtaining the domain-shared representations from unlabeled data in both the source and target domains. Using the domain-shared representation, we train the model on annotated data from the source domain and then apply it to make predictions in the target domain. Experimental results across ten transfer tasks using four public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms other baseline models.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis refers to the task of determining the sentiment polarity associated with particular aspects mentioned in a sentence or document. Previous studies have used attention-based neural network models to connect aspect terms with context words, but these models often perform poorly due to limited interaction between aspect terms and opinion words. Furthermore, these models typically focus only on explicitly stated aspect objects, which can be overly restrictive in certain scenarios. Current sentiment analysis methods that rely on aspect categories also often fail to consider the implicit placement of aspect-category information within the context. While existing models may produce strong results, they often lack domain knowledge. To address these issues, this study proposes an Aspect-position and Entity-oriented Knowledge Convolutional Graph (APEKCG) consisting of two modules: the Aspect position-aware module (APA) and the Entity oriented Knowledge Dependency Convolutional Graph (EKDCG). The APA module is designed to integrate aspect-specific sentiment features for sentiment classification by incorporating information about aspect categories into different parts of the context. The EKDCG module incorporates entity-oriented knowledge, dependency labels, and syntactic path using a dependence graph. Experimental results on five benchmarks Natural Language Processing (NLP) datasets of the English language demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed APEKCG framework. Furthermore, the APEKCG outperformed previous state-of-the-art models with its accuracy, achieving 89.13%, 84.32%, 89.02%, 79.64%, and 90.22% on the MAMS, Laptop, Restaurant, AWARE, and SemEval-15&16 datasets, respectively.}

However, a common challenge faced by these methods is the inclusion of irrelevant words in the extracted keywords, leading to decreased classification accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose an aspect-based context multiple iteration approach, which leverages the correlation between aspects and context and employs the multi-head attention mechanism to iteratively extract contextual keywords. By doing so, we aim to mitigate the interference of irrelevant words and enhance the accuracy of sentiment classification. Additionally, we address the peculiarities of hard samples by introducing a novel loss function that cleverly incorporates the hyperbolic tangent function and allows for improved model accuracy.

Some comments do not contain explicit opinion words but still convey a clear human-perceived emotional orientation, which is known as implicit sentiment. Most previous research relies on contextual information from a text for implicit aspect-based sentiment analysis. However, little work has integrated external knowledge with contextual information. This paper proposes an implicit aspect-based sentiment analysis model combining supervised contrastive learning with knowledge-enhanced fine-tuning on BERT (BERT-SCL+KEFT). In the pre-training phase, the model utilizes supervised contrastive learning (SCL) on large-scale sentiment-annotated corpora to acquire sentiment knowledge. In the fine-tuning phase, the model uses a knowledge-enhanced fine-tuning (KEFT) method to capture explicit and implicit aspect-based sentiments. Specifically, the model utilizes knowledge embedding to embed external general knowledge information into textual entities by using knowledge graphs, enriching textual information. Finally, the model combines external knowledge and contextual features to predict the implicit sentiment in a text. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BERT-SCL+KEFT model outperforms other baselines on the general implicit sentiment analysis and implicit aspect-based sentiment analysis tasks. In addition, ablation experimental results show that the proposed BERT-SCL+KEFT model without the knowledge embedding module or supervised contrastive learning module significantly decreases performance, indicating the importance of these modules. All experiments validate that the proposed BERT-SCL+KEFT model effectively achieves implicit aspect-based sentiment classification.}

With the rise of graph convolution networks (GCNs), current ABSA models mostly use graph-based methods. These methods construct a dependency tree for each sentence, and regard each word as a unique node. To be more specific, they conduct classification using aspect representations instead of sentence representations, and update them with GCNs. However, this kind of method relies too much on the quality of the dependency tree and may lose the global sentence information, which is also helpful for classification. To deal with these, we design a new ABSA model AG-VSR. Two kinds of representations are proposed to perform the final classification, Attention-assisted Graph-based Representation (A2GR) and Variational Sentence Representation (VSR). A2GR is produced by the GCN module, which inputs a dependency tree modified by the attention mechanism. Furthermore, VSR is sampled from a distribution learned by a VAE-like encoder–decoder structure. Extensive experiments show that our model AG-VSR achieves competitive results.

abstract = {Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a crucial natural language understanding (NLU) research field which aims to accurately recognize reviewers’ opinions on different aspects of products and services. Despite the prominence of recent ABSA applications, mainstream ABSA approaches inevitably rely on large-scale supervised corpora, and their final performances is susceptible to the quality of the training datasets. However, annotating sufficient data is labour intensive, which presents a significant barrier for generalizing a high-quality sentiment analysis model. Nonetheless, humans can make more accurate judgement based on their external background knowledge, such as factoid triples knowledge and event causality. Inspired by the investigations on external knowledge enhancement strategies in other popular NLP research, we propose a novel knowledge augmentation framework for ABSA, named the Oxford Dictionary descriptive knowledge-infused aspect-based sentiment analysis (DictABSA). Comprehensive experiments with many state-of-the-art approaches on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed DictABSA significantly outperforms previous mainstream ABSA methods. For instance, compared with the baselines, our BERT-based knowledge infusion strategy achieves a substantial 6.42% and 5.26% absolute accuracy gain when adopting BERT-SPC on SemEval2014 and ABSA-DeBERTa on ACLShortData, respectively. Furthermore, to effectively make use of dictionary knowledge we devise several alternative knowledge infusion strategies. Extensive experiments using different knowledge infused strategies further demonstrate that the proposed knowledge infusion strategies effectively enhance the sentiment polarity identification capability. The Python implementation of our DictABSA is publicly available at https://github.com/albert-jin/DictionaryFused-E2E-ABSA.}

abstract = {The increasing interactive content in the Internet motivated researchers and data scientists to conduct Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) research to understand the various sentiments and the different aspects of a product in a single user’s comment. Determining the various aspects along with their polarities (positive, negative, or neutral) from a single comment is a challenging problem. To this end, we have designed and developed a deep learning model based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and features extracted using the Multilingual Universal Sentence Encoder (MUSE). The proposed Pooled-GRU model trained on a Hotels’ Arabic reviews to address two ABSA tasks: (1) aspect extraction, and (2) aspect polarity classification. The proposed model achieved high results with 93.0% F1 score in the former task and 90.86% F1 score in the latter task. Our experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the baseline model and the related research methods evaluated on the same dataset. More precisely, our proposed model showed 62.1% improvement in the F1 score over the baseline model for the aspect extraction task and 15% improvement in the accuracy over the baseline model for the aspect polarity classification task.}

abstract = {In the era of rapid technological advancement, users generate an overwhelming volume of data on social media networks and e-commerce platforms daily. This data, rich in opinions, sentiments, values, and habits, holds immense value for both consumers and businesses. Leveraging this unstructured data manually is error-prone and time-consuming. The field of Sentiment Analysis automates the process of analyzing human opinions from this data. Sentiment Analysis classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. However, it confines text classification to a single sentiment polarity, providing a broad overview without accounting for specific aspects. With the growing demand for data analysis, this standard sentiment polarity classification is no longer sufficient. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis has emerged to dig deeper into the text, uncovering perspectives and points of view. It can identify multiple aspects in text with corresponding sentiment polarity. Therefore, interest in this field has increased and many research efforts have been devoted recently to tackle this problem for the English language. Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of Arabic research in this field. This study will address the aforementioned deficiency by investigating the potential of four transformer models namely, AraBERT v2.0, ArBERT, MARBERT, and Multilingual BERT in enhancing the accuracy of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis for Arabic texts using two dedicated corpora (AraMA and AraMAMS). The extensive experiments revealed that the proposed approach achieved its expected effect surpassing the results of previous studies in the field. The best results of Aspect Category Detection and Aspect Sentiment Classification tasks in AraMA corpus were obtained by using AraBERT v2.0 with F1-Measure result equals to 95.75% and 92.83% respectively. In addition, the best result of Aspect Category Detection and Aspect Sentiment Classification tasks in AraMAMS corpus were achieved by using AraBERT v2.0 with F1-Measure result equals to 95.54% and 89.52% respectively.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims at determining the sentiment polarity of the given aspect term in a sentence. Recently, graph convolution network (GCN) has been used in the ABSA task and obtained promising results. Despite the proliferation of the methods and their success, prevailing models based on GCN lack a powerful constraint mechanism for the message passing to aspect terms, introducing heavy noise during graph convolution. Further, they simply average the subword vectors from BERT to form word-level embeddings, failing to fully exploit the potentials of BERT. To overcome these downsides, a graph convolutional network with multiple weight mechanisms is proposed for aspect-based sentiment analysis in the paper. Specifically, a dynamic weight alignment mechanism is proposed to encourage our model to make full use of BERT. Then an aspect-aware weight mechanism is designed to control message propagation to aspect during graph convolution operation. Afterwards, an aspect-oriented loading layer is presented to further reduce adverse effects of words irrelevant with aspect term. Finally, the multi-head self attention is used to fuse high order semantic and syntax information. Hence, the model can obtain the premium aspect-specific representations for prediction. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art results compared to other models.}

abstract = {Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a modern and effective form of sentiment analysis that enables the extraction of highly representative features of source textual data. Recent solutions rely on models built upon Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) embeddings and large manually-tagged datasets. This implies that usage of such methods requires large amounts of gold-tagged domain-specific data and is vulnerable to data drifts, while not being able to recognize segmented and summarize more complex terms. We propose an open-domain generative method for ASTE based on Generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) with few-shot and fine-tuning strategies. This method has shown to be applicable for the task, with the models being capable of consistent structuring of the output triplet, simplification of the terms without losing meaningful information, as well as successful analysis of data from unknown domains. Resulting models was tested on mixed domain Russian-language automatically tagged data with thorough manual editing by means of a large language model (LLM) with a few-shot approach and English data, which was only automatically tagged. The developed models have shown to take advantage of the ability to perform learning in a few-shot way, allowing knowledge distillation from larger to cardinally smaller ones. Models have also been tested on summarizing of large amounts of reviews and have shown results comparable to enterprise grade solutions.}
